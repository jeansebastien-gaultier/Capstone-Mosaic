As Portillo's expands into new markets, the company faces risks associated with commodity and food price fluctuations, which can be impacted by factors beyond its control, such as raw material inputs, geopolitical events, and weather conditions, affecting the availability and pricing of ingredients and packaging materials.

Portillo's relies on a variety of commodities to prepare its food, including wheat, beef, chicken, and produce, which are subject to global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations, and weather patterns. For instance, a drought in a major wheat-producing region could lead to higher prices and reduced availability of wheat flour, impacting Portillo's iconic hot dogs and other menu items.

Futhermore, market volatility can also affect the prices of packaging materials, such as cardboard and plastic, which are essential for keeping Portillo's products fresh and appealing to customers. When these prices fluctuate, Portillo's may need to adjust its production costs, potentially affecting profitability and competitiveness in new markets.

As Portillo's expands geographically, it may also encounter regional differences in commodity availability and prices, requiring the company to adapt its supply chain and pricing strategies to meet local market conditions.

operate new restaurants profitably and increase AUV and same-restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond

commodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our
control and include raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets and global supply and demand
dynamics, among other items. In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter

Portillo's strategy for direct shipping and off-premise sales involves minimizing commodity price risks by monitoring primary ingredients, entering into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements, and adapting to fluctuations in raw material inputs, supply and demand dynamics, and global market conditions to maintain a stable supply chain.

To achieve this, Portillo's constantly monitors the prices of its key ingredients, such as beef, poultry, produce, and dairy products, to identify trends and potential disruptions. This allows the company to negotiate favorable purchasing contracts with suppliers and adjust its menu offerings to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations.

2022, an increase of $19.5 million or 12.6%. This increase was primarily driven by the opening of twelve restaurants in the year ended
December 31, 2023 and the opening of three restaurants in 2022, and incremental investments to support our team members, including
annual rate increases, and higher variable-based compensation. As a percentage of revenues, net, labor decreased 0.7% during the year

rate increases to support our team members, lower transactions, and higher labor utilization. Occupancy Expenses

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our revenues are typically nominally higher during the second, third and fourth

year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Initial Public Offering

In contrast, the slower season from November to March often leads to lower sales and profits, requiring the company to implement cost-cutting measures to maintain profitability. As a result, Portillo's quarterly results can be volatile, making it essential to analyze their financial performance over a full fiscal year to gain a comprehensive understanding of their operations."
