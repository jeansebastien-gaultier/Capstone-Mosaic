week, which resulted in incremental revenue of approximately $13.9 million. • Same-restaurant sales* increased 5.7%."
2,What are Portillo’s growth plans for restaurant expansion in the future?,"Portillo’s aims to grow its restaurant base by 12% to 15% annually over the long term. They plan to open new restaurants in existing and new markets, focusing on areas like Arizona, Texas, and Florida. In the future, they see potential for over 900 restaurants domestically, including full-scale and smaller pick-up/walk-up models.","In fiscal 2023, we opened 12 new restaurants. Over the long term, we aim to increase our number of restaurants by
approximately 12% to 15% annually. Our near-term restaurant growth strategy is focused on leveraging our proven unit economic model
primarily in markets outside
Chicagoland with favorable macro-economic tailwinds where we already have a presence. Particularly, our short-term focus is in the

3,What impact did inflation have on Portillo’s food costs in 2023?,"Portillo's faced 5.5% commodity price inflation in 2023, primarily driven by rising input costs. This follows even higher commodity inflation of 15.2% in 2022.","Commodity inflation was

2023, we experienced a decrease of 0.7% in labor expenses, as a percentage of revenue, compared to the year ended December 25,
2022 primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by higher labor utilization and additional wage investments. We strategically
offset these expenses through menu price increases and operational efficiencies. In the year ended December 31, 2023, same-restaurant sales, operating income, net income, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and
