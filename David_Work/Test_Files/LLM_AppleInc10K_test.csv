It integrates hardware, software, and services, ensuring high-quality standards across its product lines. Apple regularly updates its products to incorporate new features and improve performance.","The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative
new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for
its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the
Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected
returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to

We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control

7,How does Apple manage its global supply chain?,"Apple relies on a global network of suppliers, primarily in Asia, to produce components and assemble products. The company works closely with these suppliers to uphold quality standards, meet environmental goals, and address supply chain risks.","The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing
partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in
China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is
currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s
supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also
outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also
reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution."
8,What are Apple’s main geographical markets?,"Apple’s main geographical markets include the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and the Asia-Pacific region. Each region contributes significantly to Apple’s revenue, with the Americas leading in overall sales.","Item 1C. Cybersecurity

9,What competitive advantages does Apple highlight?,"Apple’s competitive advantages include its strong brand, extensive ecosystem of devices and services, innovative design, and a high level of customer loyalty. Its integration of hardware, software, and services creates a unique user experience that sets Apple apart.","In addition, some of the
Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain
competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of
the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications
within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer."
10,How does Apple ensure data privacy and security for its users?,"Apple prioritizes privacy by designing products and services with features like data encryption, anonymization, and strict control over app permissions. Apple emphasizes transparency with its users regarding data use and continuously improves security protocols.","These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal
business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products
and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to
litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks
are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques
that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the
Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers
can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many
companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and
the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent
unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of
encryption and authentication technologies."
11,What role does the App Store play in Apple's business model?,"The App Store is a major revenue source for Apple, offering apps, games, and digital content from third-party developers. Apple retains a commission on sales within the App Store, supporting its overall services revenue and enhancing the ecosystem’s value.","Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store.

impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with
by March 2024."
12,How is Apple expanding its services segment?,"Apple’s services segment includes offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+. By expanding these services, Apple provides value to device users while creating recurring revenue sources that diversify its income.","The offerings provide
priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement

It actively works on increasing diverse representation across its workforce, fostering an inclusive culture, and supporting equitable pay and access to opportunities for all employees.","The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their
needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide
variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’

15,What risks does Apple face with its reliance on single-source suppliers?,"Relying on single-source suppliers can pose risks if supply is disrupted due to unforeseen events. Apple manages this by working closely with suppliers and diversifying sourcing options, but some components remain unique to specific suppliers.","Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to

environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely
affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or
feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for
the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and
changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied."

It focuses on areas like advanced hardware, software, machine learning, and health technology to maintain its competitive edge.","The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative

19,How does Apple manage component and product quality?,"Apple enforces strict quality standards throughout its supply chain, working closely with suppliers to ensure compliance. Products undergo rigorous testing and quality control measures before they reach consumers.","The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in
China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data

20,What challenges does Apple face in its global markets?,"Apple faces challenges including regulatory issues, currency fluctuations, economic conditions, and competition. The company adapts its strategies to each market while navigating these factors to maintain its global presence.","The weakness in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which
consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant
announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:

The company addresses this by forecasting demand and planning product transitions effectively.","It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various
aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such
licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future
on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of
sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches."

We have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the
“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related

43,How does Apple handle cybersecurity threats?,"Apple invests in robust security measures, including encryption, secure hardware design, and regular software updates to protect against cyber threats. It also monitors for vulnerabilities and works proactively to secure its systems and user data.","As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all
eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty
password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’
employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for
unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the
Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for
unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or
loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not

currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which
