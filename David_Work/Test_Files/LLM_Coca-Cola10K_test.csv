0,Can you provide a brief overview of your company and its main business activities?,"The Coca-Cola Company is a global beverage leader with operations in over 200 countries. It produces, licenses, and markets a wide variety of beverage brands, including sparkling soft drinks, water, coffee, juice, and plant-based beverages. The company’s core business activities involve selling beverage concentrates and syrups to bottling partners, who produce and distribute finished products. Coca-Cola also engages in direct operations in certain markets, especially through retail and Costa coffee stores.","We generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling
partners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own
business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling partners have the right to
manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain
operating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling
partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing
their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources
to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse
effect on our profitability."
1,What is Coca-Cola’s mission and vision?,"Coca-Cola’s mission is to ""refresh the world and make a difference."" Its vision revolves around three pillars: creating loved brands, growing sustainably, and investing in a shared future. The company is committed to positive environmental and social impact through initiatives in waste reduction, water conservation, and community investment.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to
reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our
renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored
by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling
partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets,
the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products. Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually
cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to
lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods."
2,How does Coca-Cola generate revenue?,"Coca-Cola generates revenue primarily through selling concentrates, syrups, and finished products. The company sells these products to bottling partners, who handle production, packaging, and distribution in local markets. Coca-Cola also has retail outlets, including Costa coffee locations, which contribute directly to revenue.","OUR BUSINESS

It serves these regions through a mix of local bottling partners and direct retail operations like Costa.","In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell
finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These
operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global
Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use
the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners
who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers."
7,What differentiates Coca-Cola from its competitors?,"Coca-Cola’s competitive edge lies in its iconic global brands, extensive distribution network, and marketing expertise. The company also benefits from strong partnerships with bottling companies and a diversified portfolio that includes both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages.","Other significant competitors include, but are not
limited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings,
Heineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and,
increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-
commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have
developed their own store or private-label beverage brands. Competitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,
in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in
production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with
marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc. ), and brand and trademark development and protection."
8,What are Coca-Cola's main distribution methods?,"Coca-Cola distributes its products through a network of independent bottling partners who manage production, packaging, and distribution in local markets. The company also directly sells through retail stores and Costa coffee locations in select markets.","The Company’s approach in alcohol focuses on three segments of alcohol ready-to-drink beverages: hard
seltzers (e.g., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer), hard alternatives (e.g., Lemon-Dou) and pre-mixed cocktails (e.g., Jack Daniel’s &
Coca-Cola). In addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other
beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers
distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in
the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the
Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers. Consumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market
to another and can change over time within a single market."
9,Who are Coca-Cola's primary competitors?,"Coca-Cola’s main competitors include global beverage companies like PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Keurig Dr Pepper, as well as regional and local brands in each market.

10,"What major challenges has Coca-Cola faced recently, and how were they addressed?","Coca-Cola has faced challenges from economic instability, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. The company responded by optimizing its supply chain, managing costs, and leveraging digital solutions to maintain efficiency. Coca-Cola also focuses on sustainable practices to reduce environmental impacts and maintain resilience.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to
reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our
renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored

We strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have
concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. We only use ingredients that are
authorized for use by regulatory authorities in each of the markets in which we operate. The Coca-Cola system works every day
to produce high-quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have rigorous product and
ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation
that provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences."
12,What are Coca-Cola's strategies for innovation?,"Coca-Cola invests in product and packaging innovation, focusing on health-conscious beverages, sustainable packaging, and digital marketing. The company also develops new flavors and offerings tailored to regional tastes, and it partners with local bottlers to rapidly scale successful innovations.","If we do not continuously strengthen
our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while strategically
expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected. Achieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products
through innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation
activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and
enforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not
successful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact
on our financial results."

by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling
partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets,
the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products. Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually
cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to
lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods."
14,What is Coca-Cola's approach to risk management?,"Coca-Cola monitors economic, geopolitical, and environmental risks, implementing strategies to mitigate their impact. This includes diversifying supply sources, managing currency risks, and strengthening partnerships with suppliers to ensure stable operations.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to
reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our
renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored

15,How does Coca-Cola manage supply chain and logistics?,"Coca-Cola works with a global network of bottlers and suppliers to maintain an efficient supply chain. The company focuses on optimizing logistics, sourcing raw materials sustainably, and using technology to manage demand and inventory effectively.","While most of Costa’s coffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from Brazil,
Vietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with direct access to yields from
cooperatives and producer groups. Our consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw
materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans;
plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon
dioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not
experienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of
suppliers. Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
Our Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively
refer to as “technology.” This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production;
packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and certain
software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties."
16,What is Coca-Cola's approach to corporate governance?,"Coca-Cola has a structured approach to corporate governance, with oversight from the board of directors. The board supports policies related to transparency, ethics, and sustainability, and it regularly reviews strategic goals and performance.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to

17,How does Coca-Cola communicate with investors?,"Coca-Cola communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, annual reports, and updates on its Investor Relations website. The company also shares news and performance updates regularly to keep investors informed of its strategies and growth.","The

Long-term, the company focuses on expanding its product portfolio, increasing market share, and pursuing sustainability goals to drive growth.","In line with our long-term bottling strategy,
we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation,
typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola
system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an
equity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations through our share of the
equity method investee’s earnings or losses. In addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations
with the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and
distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These
investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which
in turn generate increased sales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the
ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating and financial policies, we account for the
investment under the equity method."
19,What are the key drivers of Coca-Cola's growth?,"Key drivers include Coca-Cola’s strong brand portfolio, product innovation, expanding customer base, and strategic acquisitions.

20,Are there any upcoming product launches or enhancements?,"Coca-Cola continually explores new products and flavors. Recent expansions have included ready-to-drink alcohol beverages in certain regions and new offerings under established brands like Fanta, Sprite, and Costa Coffee.","If we do not continuously strengthen

23,How does Coca-Cola handle fluctuations in currency and raw material costs?,Coca-Cola uses hedging strategies to manage currency risks and collaborates with suppliers to stabilize raw material costs. The company also seeks to offset cost pressures by adjusting prices and optimizing its supply chain.,"These
regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the
Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging
materials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to
increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and
expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and
other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which
our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process."

27,How does Coca-Cola manage sustainability in its packaging?,"Coca-Cola is committed to sustainable packaging, aiming for 100% recyclability in its products. The company uses recycled materials and partners with environmental organizations to encourage recycling efforts. Coca-Cola also continues to research and develop eco-friendly packaging alternatives to reduce plastic waste.","We and our
bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely
recyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our
bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling
concerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may
cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time
we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the environment by, for
example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are
made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable
glass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our
beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already
in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by
nongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our
progress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely
affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental concerns, governmental entities in the
United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and
policies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled
content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials."
28,What role does Coca-Cola’s distribution network play in its success?,"Coca-Cola’s extensive distribution network is key to its success, enabling the company to deliver its products quickly and efficiently to retailers worldwide. By partnering with local bottlers, Coca-Cola ensures that its beverages are available in both urban and rural areas, adapting distribution strategies to each market’s needs.","Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of
brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market. Distribution System
We make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network
of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution
operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of
42.2 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing,
distributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world. The Coca-Cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively."
29,How does Coca-Cola adapt its products for different international markets?,"Coca-Cola customizes its product offerings to meet regional tastes and cultural preferences. For example, it offers tea-based drinks in Asia and region-specific flavors in Latin America. This localized approach helps Coca-Cola maintain relevance in diverse markets and resonate with a broad consumer base.","OUR BUSINESS
General

since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands,
which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice,
value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest

30,What challenges does Coca-Cola face with supply chain management?,"Coca-Cola faces challenges such as rising material costs, environmental factors, and global logistics disruptions. The company works with multiple suppliers to secure materials like sugar, water, and packaging, and uses technology to enhance supply chain transparency and efficiency.","These
regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the
Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging
materials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to
increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and
expenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and
other packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Water scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity. Water is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which
our business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process."
31,What environmental factors could impact Coca-Cola's operations?,"Environmental factors such as water scarcity, extreme weather, and agricultural issues can affect Coca-Cola’s supply of raw materials. To mitigate these, Coca-Cola implements water conservation initiatives, sources ingredients responsibly, and invests in sustainable agricultural practices.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to
reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our
renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored
by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling
partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets,
the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products. Adverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually
cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to
lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods."
32,What are Coca-Cola’s main corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives?,"Coca-Cola’s CSR initiatives include water conservation, community support, and waste reduction. The company focuses on empowering local communities, supporting recycling efforts, and providing clean water access. Coca-Cola’s CSR programs aim to make a positive impact in areas where it operates.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to

33,What recent acquisitions has Coca-Cola made to expand its product offerings?,"Coca-Cola has acquired brands like Costa Coffee and BodyArmor to diversify its portfolio beyond soft drinks. These acquisitions allow Coca-Cola to enter new markets such as coffee and sports drinks, appealing to a wider audience and tapping into growing beverage categories.","OUR BUSINESS

The digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and
stakeholders. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and
more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through
digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the
Coca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of
data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not
successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively
affected, and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may
adversely impact our financial performance."

The company aims to increase market share in categories beyond soft drinks, such as coffee, plant-based beverages, and ready-to-drink alcoholic products.","In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to

Company and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase
prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing
costs along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create
additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the
value of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues."
40,What challenges does Coca-Cola face regarding water usage?,"Water is a critical ingredient in Coca-Cola’s products, and the company faces challenges related to water scarcity in certain regions.

flooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the
Coca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair
25production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change
also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations. Increased energy or
compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the
costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products. The physical effects and transition costs of
