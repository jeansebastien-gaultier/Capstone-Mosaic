    "PART I\n",
    " Portillo’s Inc. (the “Company\") was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 8, 2021, in connection with our initial public offering in\n",
    " October 2021 (\"IPO\") and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the \"Transactions”) in order to carry on the business of PHD\n",
    " Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (“Portillo’s OpCo”). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October 20, 2021, the\n",
    " Company became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo and now operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Portillo's\n",
    " OpCo. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Portillo's OpCo and reports a non-controlling interest representing\n",
    " the economic interest in Portillo's OpCo held by the other members of Portillo's OpCo (the \"pre-IPO LLC Members\"). Unless the context\n",
    " otherwise requires, references to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"Portillo's,\" the \"Company\" and other similar references refer to Portillo's Inc. and its\n",
    " subsidiaries, including Portillo’s OpCo.\n",
    " Overview of Portillo's\n",
    " Portillo’s serves iconic Chicago street food in high-energy, multichannel restaurants designed to ignite the senses and create memorable\n",
    " dining experiences. Since our founding in 1963 in a small trailer that Dick Portillo called “The Dog House,” we have grown to become a\n",
    " treasured brand with a passionate (some might say obsessed) nationwide following. Our diverse menu features all-American favorites\n",
    " such as Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers, chopped salads, crinkle-cut fries, homemade\n",
    " chocolate cake and signature chocolate cake shake. We create a consumer experience like no other by combining the best attributes of\n",
    " fast-casual and quick-service concepts with an exciting energy-filled atmosphere in a restaurant model capable of generating tremendous\n",
    " volumes. Nearly all of our restaurants were built with double lane drive-thrus and have been thoughtfully designed with a layout that\n",
    " accommodates a variety of access modes including dine-in, carryout, delivery and catering to quickly and efficiently serve our guests. No\n",
    " matter how our guests order from us, our highly productive kitchens and team members consistently serve high-quality food and deliver a\n",
    " memorable guest experience. We believe the combination of our craveable food, multichannel sales model, dedication to operational\n",
    " excellence, and distinctive team member-driven culture gives us a competitive advantage. Our business, including many of the elements\n",
    " described below, is subject to certain risks that may materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our desired outcomes. For a\n",
    " more in-depth discussion of such risks, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\n",
    " As of December 31, 2023, we owned and operated 84 restaurants across 10 states, including a restaurant owned by C&O Chicago,\n",
    " L.L.C. (\"C&O\") of which we own 50% of the equity .\n",
    " Our Story\n",
    " We relish the opportunity to create lifelong memories by igniting the senses with unrivaled food and experiences.\n",
    " An Iconic and Beloved Brand with Obsessed, Lifelong Fans . We capture the hearts, minds and stomachs of our guests with every\n",
    " meal. Our menu features something for everyone and appeals to a broad demographic, which enables our restaurants to thrive and\n",
    " generate strong and balanced volumes across multiple dayparts, weekdays and occasions. No matter the location, our fans are\n",
    " bun-believably obsessed! Guests cake shake their way in for our Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers,\n",
    " cheese fries, fresh salads and famous chocolate cake. Our new restaurant openings draw massive crowds of passionate fans with lines\n",
    " stretching around the block.\n",
    " Energetic Restaurant Atmosphere that Engages the Senses. While our operating model is focused on getting delicious, made-to-order\n",
    " food to our guests quickly, our atmosphere makes the experience more than a delicious meal. When guests walk into a Portillo’s, they get\n",
    " an experience completely different than a typical chain restaurant visit. Our restaurants engage all the senses to create a fun, relaxed and\n",
    " memorable occasion.\n",
    " Our dining areas evoke nostalgia and local influences. No two Portillo’s are alike. Each of our restaurants has its own themed décor,\n",
    " ranging from a 1930s prohibition motif to a 1950s diner to a 1960s flower-power bus, as well as a retro automotive garage theme. The\n",
    " period music ties to the theme, from ragtime to doo wop to disco. No detail is too small, be it lighting, signage or even the stars subtly\n",
    " sparkling on the ceiling. Each restaurant also draws design elements from the local community. The layouts create spaces comfortable for\n",
    " individual diners, families, large groups, and even wedding parties.\n",
    " Beyond the space itself, the energy of a Portillo’s is unique. Our guests can see into our open kitchens, where their meals are prepared\n",
    " right before their eyes. The smells of burgers broiling, french fries frying, and beef simmering emanate from the kitchen. Each completed\n",
    " meal is announced with a fun rhyme (“Number two, we got you”; “Number seven, welcome to Portillo’s heaven”). But the most important\n",
    " element of the energy is the enthusiasm of the scores of guests who are all excited to be there and enjoying their Portillo’s. We want\n",
    " every guest that visits to leave with good memories, a satiated appetite and a desire to return.\n",
    " Our Food\n",
    "Our Menu. Our menu features unrivaled Chicago-style street food and all-American favorites — something for everyone! We're known for\n",
    " our famous Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, chopped salad, cheese fries, homemade chocolate cake, and chocolate cake\n",
    " shake. Our Italian beef is slow-roasted for four hours, thinly sliced, and served on freshly-baked French bread. Then, it's dipped in hot\n",
    " gravy made with our homemade blend of seasonings that we've been perfecting for 60 years. Our Chicago-style hot dogs feature\n",
    " mustard, relish, freshly chopped onion, sliced red-ripe tomatoes, a kosher pickle and sport peppers piled high onto a perfectly steamed\n",
    " poppy seed bun, all finished with a few shakes of savory celery salt. Guests also love our craveable crinkle-cut french fries which are\n",
    " cooked in beef tallow, resulting in a perfectly salted, crispy outside with a soft inside. Lastly, for those craving something sweet, our\n",
    " famous homemade fluffy chocolate cakes are baked with love each morning in every restaurant and generously iced with rich chocolate\n",
    " frosting.\n",
    " Commitment to Quality. Our made-to-order food is prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and our commitment to quality can be\n",
    " seen in every item on the menu. We have been perfecting our menu for 60 years, and we are constantly seeking ways to further enhance\n",
    " the quality and desirability of our offerings.\n",
    " Menu Innovation. We intend to drive traffic through truly craveable foods that can be made with a Portillo’s spin. New menu items are\n",
    " introduced when we believe they will offer superior guest satisfaction and typically coincide with the removal of an existing menu item to\n",
    " ensure a manageable menu size, allowing our team members to maintain the operational efficiency that enables our high volumes and\n",
    " consistently high quality offerings. Recent examples of new menu items include our Spicy Chicken Sandwich featuring our proprietary\n",
    " spicy giardiniera sauce, launched in 2021, the Plant-based Garden Dog, launched in 2022, and our Rodeo Burger, launched in 2023,\n",
    " featuring our homemade barbecue sauce and premium bacon. The Rodeo Burger combines existing ingredients in a unique way , while\n",
    " highlighting our improved ingredients, such as bacon. We also offer seasonal shakes and specialty cakes to complement our existing\n",
    " menu.\n",
    " In 2023 , we opened our Innovation Center, a test kitchen that allows us to explore new menu items and refinements to our operational\n",
    " procedures. Our teams leverage this space to efficiently explore new opportunities as we continue to grow.\n",
    " Our Sales Channels\n",
    " Our restaurants are thoughtfully designed for both their variety of access modes and the overall guest experience.\n",
    " Drive-Thru. Our restaurants are built with double lane drive-thrus staffed with engaging attendants that ensure a pleasant and efficient\n",
    " experience with all food made to order.\n",
    " Dine-In. Our restaurant dining rooms are elaborately decorated with timeless, nostalgic designs inspired by the local community. Our\n",
    " dining areas feature a variety of flexible seating arrangements designed to accommodate single diners, couples, families and large\n",
    " groups. Guests dining in our restaurants wait in an ordering line to place their order and walk up to a designated pick-up area when their\n",
    " order is called.\n",
    " Carryout. Guests placing a carryout order can order at the restaurant, on our website, through our app, or through certain third-party\n",
    " platforms and walk into the restaurant to pick up their order at our dedicated pickup shelves.\n",
    " Delivery. We have established partnerships with multiple third-party delivery providers.\n",
    " Catering Offerings. Our catering offerings include buffet-style packages of our ready-to-eat favorites like Italian beef, sausages and\n",
    " meatballs, gourmet salads, pastas and whole cakes. We also sell “Take & Make” offerings – a series of catering items and packages\n",
    " designed for convenient, at-home preparation by our guests. For impromptu gatherings, we offer “Fast Packs,” which are convenient\n",
    " packages of our most popular menu items, prewrapped and ready to top, which can be prepared and delivered quickly. We have also\n",
    " added in-house delivery capability to fulfill catering orders through our team members.\n",
    " Direct Shipping Offerings. Our direct shipping offerings include some of our most popular menu items, including Italian beef (8 sandwich\n",
    " or 20 sandwich pack), Chicago-style hot dogs (10 or 50 pack), sausages, chocolate cake and tamales.\n",
    " Our Growth Strategies\n",
    " Expand and Strengthen Our Restaurant Base . We are in the early stages of our nationwide growth plan, with 84 locations across ten\n",
    " states as of December 31, 2023, including C&O . Since 2015, we have opened new restaurants at a compounded annual growth rate of\n",
    " approximately 9.2%. In fiscal 2023, we opened 12 new restaurants. Over the long term, we aim to increase our number of restaurants by\n",
    " approximately 12% to 15% annually. Our near-term restaurant growth strategy is focused on leveraging our proven unit economic model\n",
    " primarily in markets outside\n",
    " Chicagoland with favorable macro-economic tailwinds where we already have a presence. Particularly, our short-term focus is in the\n",
    " Sunbelt, with growth across markets in Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Simultaneously, we will continue to fill-in Chicagoland and adjacent\n",
    " markets as opportunities come available. Over the past year, our development function has made great strides in creating scalable,\n",
    " repeatable processes, giving us confidence as we grow nationally.\n",
    "Based on a whitespace analysis prepared in partnership with a third-party vendor in 2023, we believe we have a substantial runway for\n",
    " growth with a long-term opportunity to grow to more than 900 restaurants domestically and are well-positioned for global growth in the\n",
    " future. Of the 900 domestic restaurants, we project 800 to be full-scale restaurants and 100 to be pick-up/walk-up models. We see these\n",
    " company-operated full-scale restaurants as our largest opportunity moving forward. At the same time, we continue to evaluate innovative\n",
    " operating models. On the heels of opening a second Portillo’s Pickup location, we will continue to analyze where these, and other\n",
    " operating models such as urban walk-ups, airports and campuses, fit within our growth trajectory to add sales, manage cannibalization,\n",
    " and provide additional pipeline growth.\n",
    " We are continuously evaluating evolving consumer preferences and footprint optimization of our restaurants. In the past, our restaurants\n",
    " were over 10,000 square feet and had 105-foot production lines. Restaurants built in 2023 are approximately 7,700 square feet with a\n",
    " 65-foot production line. In the future, we are planning for restaurants generally in the range of 5,500 to 6,000 square feet with an\n",
    " approximate 47-foot production line. Overall, we are committed to improving the experience for our guests and team members. The\n",
    " evolution of our restaurants has come as a three-stage process. Stage One focuses on retrofitting our existing restaurant base. These\n",
    " retrofits involve adding a \"Grab & Go\" area, which includes desserts, bottled water and Portillo's retail merchandise. This area previously\n",
    " housed our salad-make line, but we merged our production lines, gaining efficiencies along the way. We also shifted our beverage\n",
    " stations to be self-serve for our guests. Stage Two is what we call \"Kitchen '23\" and is improving the efficiency in our new builds by\n",
    " reducing the square footage, reducing the length of the production line, lowering equipment costs and enhancing our off-premise area\n",
    " with drive thru doors. Stage Three is what we refer to as \"Restaurant of the Future\" which will bring the square footage down to 5,500 to\n",
    " 6,000 square feet and a 47-foot production line, all without compromising our ability to achieve our industry leading average unit volume\n",
    " (\"AUV\"). When we move to a box of this size, we will need less than our typically two-acre site to build, which will create more real estate\n",
    " possibilities. Further, these enhancements reduce conveyance and increase productivity.\n",
    " Increase Our Same-Restaurant Sales. We aim to continue delivering an outstanding value proposition to our guests and enhance our\n",
    " guest experience to grow our volumes. We believe the following initiatives will drive same-restaurant sales growth.\n",
    " • Deliver a Consistently Outstanding Guest Experience Across Order Channels . Portillo’s remains committed to offering industry\n",
    "leading experiences across our traditional sales channels, while continuing to grow and innovate in growth sales channels.\n",
    " Dine-in provides the best Portillo’s experience, so we strive for our dine-in experience to represent the heart of Portillo’s and our\n",
    " company values of Family, Greatness, Energy, and Fun. In our drive-thru, we strive to maintain top performance in the industry\n",
    " across speed, service, and accuracy. In new markets, we show new guests the value and efficiency of our drive-thrus. In our\n",
    " sales channels of digital pickup, delivery, and catering we have made great strides operationally that will allow us to win additional\n",
    " market share.\n",
    " • Protect our Incredible Value Proposition. Experience, service, and food quality define value in our brand, but maintaining a strong\n",
    " price point remains a high priority given how broadly we compete in the restaurant industry. Our teams consistently monitor price\n",
    " points across the many segments and occasions that are relevant to our guests. We will continue our price laggard strategy\n",
    " combined with a focus on operational excellence to succeed moving forward.\n",
    " • Purposeful Menu Enhancements . We are constantly studying ways to further enhance our existing offerings while thoughtfully\n",
    " adding new high-quality items. We are also disciplined in maintaining the size of our menu, ensuring consistency in execution\n",
    " while maintaining the variety that helps drive our industry-leading volumes. For example, in 2023, we launched our Rodeo Burger,\n",
    " an item that combines existing ingredients in a unique way, enhanced the guest experience, and provided a benefit to average\n",
    " ticket price and profit margin. We believe this purposeful innovation drives increased guest frequency and reinforces the everyday\n",
    " value proposition that is key to our success. Moving forward, we will continue to consider menu enhancements to re-invigorate\n",
    " our core guests while drawing in new guests.\n",
    " • Drive Brand Awareness and Trial Through Marketing. We believe the best way to market Portillo’s is to have people try our food.\n",
    " We drive awareness and trial through our grassroots local restaurant marketing team, by utilizing our Beef Bus food truck to\n",
    " promote new restaurants, and by producing creative and engaging marketing content. Our goal is to harness brand love and\n",
    " spread it far and wide. We do so by leaning on influencers and traditional media to spread our messages. We use a full suite of\n",
    " communication channels, such as email, X (formerly known as \"Twitter\"), Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other platforms to\n",
    " spread our message to different customer segments.\n",
    " ◦ In 2023, we partnered with the town of Bacon, Indiana to launch our new Rodeo Burger. We invited digital content\n",
    " creators and traditional press to join us in Bacon for a “Bacon Rodeo,” featuring Bacon Burgers served out of our Beef\n",
    " Bus food truck. The local “Lick Creek Band” was on hand to perform and even performed a custom Portillo’s song to\n",
    " commemorate the event. This activity allowed us to produce several months’ worth of digital content, leading to a\n",
    " successful launch of our new burger.\n",
    " ◦ In the fourth quarter of 2023, we debuted a new ad campaign in Chicagoland called, “Portillo’s. It always sounds good.”\n",
    " In addition to showing off our delicious food, the campaign incorporated sounds from within a Portillo’s restaurant – the\n",
    " sound of a saltshaker over our French fries, the crispy crunch of our onion rings, and the sound of our team members\n",
    " rhyming while handing out orders. The ad campaign consisted of commercials, billboards, and partnerships with several\n",
    " digital media outlets, such as Barstool Sports, to reach our guests across the Chicagoland. The campaign drove\n",
    " incremental traffic to our restaurants and our guests loved the creative ads.\n",
    " Leverage Our Infrastructure to Drive Profitability. Our attractive business model generates strong operating margins and cash flow.\n",
    " We constantly focus on restaurant-level operations while ensuring that we do not sacrifice the quality and experience for which we are\n",
    " known. Our strong average unit volumes and operational focus allow us to manage variable costs and leverage fixed costs. We believe\n",
    "we will continue to grow revenue and system-wide profitability by executing our growth strategy and leveraging the experience of our\n",
    " existing general managers to drive successful and efficient new restaurant openings. Our investments to enhance and expand our\n",
    " multichannel capabilities and drive a frictionless guest order experience are also expected to further leverage our fixed costs. In addition,\n",
    " we have made and continue to make significant investments at the corporate level, such as the implementation of a new enterprise\n",
    " resource planning system, which we will leverage in the future.\n",
    " Our Team – Human Capital Management\n",
    " Our team member base, as of December 31, 2023, consisted of 8,180 team members. This included 190 Restaurant Support Center\n",
    " (“RSC”) team members, 439 res taurant managers, assistant general managers, and general managers, and 7,455 restaurant hourly team\n",
    " members in positions such as crew chief, training lead, food production and guest services. We also have 85 hourly team members,\n",
    " which also includes crew chiefs, and 11 managers and above at our commissaries. Our restaurant team members are not covered by any\n",
    " collective bargaining agreements. On April 13, 2023, certain of our team members at one of our commissaries voted in favor of being\n",
    " represented by a union. We filed objections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") on April 19, 2023, asserting\n",
    " that the union and its agent's promises prevented a free and fair election. We have appealed to the NLRB to set aside the election results.\n",
    " Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital programs. The Compensation Committee, with\n",
    " input from management and an independent third-party compensation consultant, has responsibility for administering and approving\n",
    " compensation, including our incentive and equity-based plans for executive officers. We discuss talent and succession plans annually for\n",
    " key positions and levels including the executive team. We have implemented and are executing several initiatives to support our\n",
    " objectives to attract, develop and retain team members.\n",
    " Values-Driven, People-Centered Culture . In 2023, Portillo’s was selected for the second year in a row by QSR Magazine as one of the\n",
    " Best Brands to Work For. We believe this reflects our conviction that our people are the Heart of Portillo’s. We attract, hire and develop\n",
    " great people who turn their obsession for our brand into a profession. Our team members are passionate about our food, love our guests,\n",
    " and call their teammates “family.” We are proud that Portillo's family is both diverse and inclusive. We strive to foster a sense of\n",
    " individuality, safety, support, belonging and fairness through inclusive practices in talent acquisition, talent management, total rewards and\n",
    " learning and development.\n",
    " This people-centric culture is centered on working together to create a fun, energetic atmosphere while living our values:\n",
    " Family\n",
    " We work together to make everyone feel at home, and we step up when someone needs help.\n",
    " Greatness\n",
    " We are obsessed with being the best and work hard to continuously improve. Our greatness is rooted in Quality, Service,\n",
    " Attitude and Cleanliness (“QSAC”).\n",
    " Energy\n",
    " We move with urgency and passion, while maintaining attention to detail.\n",
    " Fun\n",
    " We entertain our guests, we connect authentically, and we make each other smile.\n",
    " These values extend beyond our restaurants, to every Portillo's team member. Living these values reinforces the culture we’re proud to\n",
    " have built. It’s why we are passionate about attracting and selecting team members who are aligned with our purpose and values, as well\n",
    " as why we established an employee value proposition centered around culture. It’s also why our team members are our best\n",
    " ambassadors and why we’ve seen success with our referral program.\n",
    " Leadership Development. We provide a full spectrum of resources, from skill building to leadership development, in the organization.\n",
    " Our philosophy is to develop people to be ready before a position is open, as opposed to waiting for a position to be open and then\n",
    " training them. We view this investment as fundamental to our growth, building a pipeline of leaders for our future.\n",
    " We are committed to continuing education and providing ways for individuals to build their talents. Portillo’s has invested in LinkedIn\n",
    " Learning for all hourly Crew Chiefs, Restaurant Management, Commissary Crew Chiefs and RSC Team Members. This initiative allows us\n",
    " to give additional learning and development opportunities above and beyond job skills or initial leadership development. We have also\n",
    " partnered with Better Up Coaching to give our leaders feedback and opportunities for personal growth.\n",
    " To ensure everyone has access to our leadership program, we continue to hold quarterly career interest days in all markets, where\n",
    " interested team members hear about opportunities within the Company and how to apply for development programs. The creation of a\n",
    " strong talent pipeline while retaining successful team members is a top priority. In 2023, we restructured our annual performance review\n",
    " process to reflect the importance of exhibiting seven leadership traits that we expect every leader to embody to be successful in our\n",
    " organization. Our growth, development, and retention strategies focus on these leadership traits to build skills to be used both\n",
    " professionally and personally. We work with team members and managers to build individual development plans with training and\n",
    " experiences, and we hold regularly scheduled development programs throughout the year for each level of leadership. Further, we hold\n",
    " bi-annual talent and succession planning summits to identify and support individuals with career pathing and development opportunities.\n",
    "We encourage team members to connect with one another in an informal mentoring program to build relationships and further create the\n",
    " sense of belonging.\n",
    " Engagement & Experience . We aspire to provide an unrivaled experience for every team member during their journey with Portillo’s.\n",
    " Creating lifelong memories for our team members and guests is paramount to the overall experience. We believe in our team members\n",
    " having a voice to share their ideas, feedback and contribute to organizational success. We continue to partner with Gallup to implement\n",
    " our EverEngaged survey to gather, listen to and act on team member feedback. We conduct this survey annually to measure\n",
    " improvement and areas of focus. In 2023, our engagement score continued to improve with statistical significance while the restaurant\n",
    " industry remained flat. Our engagement results for multi-unit and general managers continue to be top quartile. Our team members\n",
    " reflected that they know what is expected of them at work and strongly agree they have what they need to do their jobs. These both are\n",
    " foundational to an individual’s engagement and success. In addition to the survey, we regularly hold roundtable discussions with team\n",
    " members and stay interviews with leaders to gain insights into ways we can cultivate an energizing, collaborative work environment.\n",
    " Additionally, we conduct an annual career aspiration survey for all RSC team members, crew chiefs, and field managers to understand\n",
    " their aspirations in development, career pathing, and what they need to succeed.\n",
    " We have also prioritized a flexible work environment, addressing life-work flexibility and balance across our different workplaces. Our\n",
    " scheduling system allows hourly team members to align their work schedule with their personal schedule, as well as submit schedules,\n",
    " time-off requests and trade shifts. For our RSC team members, we provide a flexible work environment. Quarterly, we hold engagement\n",
    "focused RSC culture weeks to bring the team together for connecting, recognition and development. In the spirit of continuing education,\n",
    " we also have a \"no meeting\" policy for Friday afternoons. Instead, our team members can use this time for professional development or\n",
    " focused work time. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, team members can also take this time for personal use and get an early start\n",
    " to the weekend.\n",
    " Total Rewards. The physical, financial, and mental well-being of our team members remains our top priority, and we continue to invest in\n",
    " their success. We believe in a total rewards philosophy of providing top quartile pay in our restaurants, especially across our leadership\n",
    " positions. We remain focused on compensating our team members equally across gender and race/ethnicity.\n",
    " This commitment is evidenced by our investment in our compensation packages and robust suite of benefit offerings. In 2023, we\n",
    " increased hourly pay across many of our geographies and for some of our restaurant management positions. Additionally, in 2023, we\n",
    " enhanced our benefits package by offering a variety of voluntary benefit options for team members to choose from including pet\n",
    " insurance, identity theft protection, critical illness coverage, and accident and hospital indemnity protection. These additional offerings\n",
    " allow our team members the flexibility to customize their coverages to best fit their needs. We also enhanced our dental plan offerings\n",
    " and expanded access to additional medical plans for our restaurant team members. To prioritize overall well-being, we also continue to\n",
    " enhance our wellness platform to provide fitness and other programs that promote wellness of the whole individual. In 2023, we also\n",
    " made enhancements to our paid leave policy.\n",
    " We believe all of our team members should act like owners of the Company, and we are committed to providing all team members with an\n",
    " ownership opportunity through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"), internally referred to as \"Beef Stock.\" Eligible employees\n",
    " can contribute up to 15% of their gross base earnings for purchases under the ESPP through regular payroll deductions, subject to an\n",
    " annual maximum dollar amount. In 2023, we issued 29,808 shares (net of shares withheld for taxes) under the ESPP. In addition to our\n",
    " Beef Stock program, all restaurant team members who are newly hired as or promoted to General Manager become eligible for our\n",
    " long-term equity incentive plan. In 2023, many of our leaders received annual grants providing our team with opportunities to own shares,\n",
    " which we believe supports retention of key team members.\n",
    " Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging. At Portillo’s, we embrace Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (\"DEIB\") through our\n",
    " core values of Family, Greatness, Energy and Fun. These values are ingrained in everything we do as a company, and they guide how we\n",
    " support our Portillo's family.\n",
    " We launched our DEIB initiative, which is sponsored by two members from our executive leadership team and one sponsor from our\n",
    " Board of Directors. It is then guided by a DEIB Advisory Group, which reviews programs ideated by our 10-member DEIB committee. This\n",
    " cross-company working group is building the framework for programs that support a diverse workforce. This includes increased\n",
    " awareness and education of our team members. We've also expanded our recruiting efforts to encourage members of underserved\n",
    " communities, such as military veterans, to join the Portillo's family.\n",
    " Heart of Portillo's Foundation. We care deeply about our people and believe that by taking care of our team members, they will in turn\n",
    " take care of our guests. In 2023, the “Heart of Portillo’s Fund,” an IRC section 501(c)(3) charitable fund raised over $300,000 to provide\n",
    " emergency assistance to team members. In 2023, the fund awarded over 60 grants and has provided support to team members for\n",
    " expenses following illness or injury, the unexpected death of a family member and other financial hardships.\n",
    " Our Sourcing and Supply Chain\n",
    " We are committed to maintaining our high-quality food standards through fresh ingredients that meet our stringent specifications. We\n",
    " partner with a variety of companies that are similarly focused on producing and providing high quality products.\n",
    " Our supply chain approach is based on alignment with key strategic partners that are identified through a comprehensive evaluation\n",
    " process to ensure our standards and expectations are met on a continual basis. This approach affords our organization the opportunity for\n",
    "real-time performance assessments to identify any potential gaps and implement corrective measures where required.\n",
    " Robust contingency plans are reviewed and updated on a regular basis to provide a reliable supply of products and services to our\n",
    " business. As part of our risk assessment strategy, the supply chain team identifies areas critical to supporting the restaurants and\n",
    " executes any necessary adjustments or alternate programs.\n",
    " Suppliers and distribution partners are managed under both a code of conduct and a pricing protocol that provides transparent insight to\n",
    " costing mechanisms. In addition, we engage directly with manufacturers to ensure compliance with negotiated contract pricing and\n",
    " requisite volume expectations.\n",
    " Distribution. Our distribution network is comprised of several independently operated partners aligned under the UniPro umbrella, the\n",
    " largest food service distribution cooperative in the United States. This strategy affords us the opportunity to align with right-sized\n",
    " organizations that are dedicated to us which allows us to leverage volume and scale for a competitive advantage and exceptional\n",
    " customer service.\n",
    " Commissaries. We operate two commissaries to supply our network of restaurants with our signature beef, peppers and gravy for our\n",
    " Italian beef sandwiches and ensure product consistency and quality. These ingredients are shipped to our restaurants where our team\n",
    " members will finish the preparation in our kitchens to serve our guests.\n",
    " Quality Systems. Quality and food safety are paramount to protecting our brand and are treated with the utmost priority. Our supplier and\n",
    " distribution partners participate in third-party audits to ensure all applicable quality system expectations are being met. Our restaurant\n",
    " locations are audited for food safety and quality compliance through a combination of third-party organizations and the Portillo's managed\n",
    " quality and food systems team. Our commissaries also undergo food safety and quality audits on a regular basis.\n",
    " While we are actively working to mitigate any effects of supply chain constraints, such constraints could result in higher food and\n",
    " beverage cost associated with general increases in input price levels as well as increased product substitutions and elevated freight costs.\n",
    " Our Competition\n",
    " The restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete primarily with quick service and fast casual concepts, and to a\n",
    " lesser extent, full-service restaurants. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition in these segments\n",
    " includes a variety of small locally owned restaurants, medium-sized regional restaurant concepts, and larger national restaurant concepts\n",
    " that provide some combination of dine-in, carry-out, drive-thru and delivery services to their guests. We believe competition with these\n",
    " restaurants is based primarily on quality and innovation in the food products offered, price and perceived value, quality of service\n",
    " experience (including technological and other innovations), speed of service, personnel, advertising and other marketing efforts, brand\n",
    " identification, restaurant location, and image and attractiveness of the restaurants.\n",
    " The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic\n",
    " trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power. We\n",
    " compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly\n",
    " personnel and suitable real estate sites. In addition, expanding product offerings at fast casual and quick-service restaurants and the\n",
    " convenience of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive\n",
    " alternatives or reduce the frequency of their restaurant visits. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.\n",
    " Our Intellectual Property\n",
    " Our intellectual property includes our trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office\n",
    " (including Portillo’s ® and other names used by our restaurants), the trade dress of our restaurants, our websites and domain names\n",
    " (including our website at portillos.com and other websites and domain names used by our restaurants) and other unregistered intellectual\n",
    " property. We take steps to enforce and maintain our intellectual property, but infringement, validity challenges and other risks may\n",
    " adversely affect or even eliminate our intellectual property.\n",
    " Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\n",
    " We are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and\n",
    " safety, nutritional content labeling, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection, and employment regulations. Failure to obtain or\n",
    " retain food or other licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operations of restaurants.\n",
    " The development of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to zoning,\n",
    " land use, water quality and retention, and environment. We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material\n",
    " effect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and\n",
    " environmental factors, among others, could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants.\n",
    " We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal, state and local\n",
    " laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt versus non-exempt, overtime, unemployment tax rates, paid leave, workers’\n",
    "compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other working conditions. Our team members are typically paid more than the\n",
    " applicable minimum wage in the area where they work, and increases in federal or state minimum wages or unemployment benefits may\n",
    " result in increases in the wage rates paid. We are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which prohibits\n",
    " discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment, which may require us to design or modify our\n",
    " restaurants to make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.\n",
    " Additionally, any difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining licenses, permits, registrations, exemptions, or approvals could delay or prevent\n",
    " the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a restaurant in a particular area.\n",
    " Seasonality\n",
    " Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our revenues are typically nominally higher during the second, third and fourth\n",
    " quarters of the fiscal year. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and\n",
    " their associated pre-opening expenses. As a result of these factors, our financial results for any single quarter or for periods of less than a\n",
    " year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\n",
    " Initial Public Offering\n",
    " The Company's registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-259810), related to its IPO was declared effective\n",
    " October 20, 2021, and the Company's Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\"Nasdaq\") under the\n",
    " symbol \"PTLO\" on October 21, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Company completed its IPO of 23,310,810 shares of the Company's\n",

    " Secondary Offerings\n",
    " In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock at\n",

    " 6,350,717 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the pre-IPO LLC Members and canceled and the Company received\n",
    " 6,350,717 newly-issued LLC Units, increasing the Company's total ownership interest in Portillo's OpCo. As a result, Portillo’s did not\n",

    " change; however, the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock increased by the same number of the canceled shares of\n",
    " Class B common stock.\n",
    " As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 76.1% of Portillo's OpCo and the pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 23.9% of\n",

    " ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS\n",
    " You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on\n",
    " Form 10-K and in our other public disclosures. Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from\n",
    " achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or\n",
    " access to sources of financing, and consequently, the market value of our Class A common stock. These risks could cause our future\n",
    " results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial\n",
    " performance. The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business.\n",
    " Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Growth Strategies\n",
    " We are vulnerable to changes in economic conditions, increases in food and commodity costs and consumer preferences.\n",
    " Like other companies in the restaurant industry, we are subject to volatility in food and commodity costs and availability that may be\n",
    " outside of our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, labor shortages, seasonal fluctuations, weather and climate\n",
    " conditions, energy costs, global demand, trade protections and subsidies, food safety issues, infectious diseases, possible terrorist\n",
    " activity, cyberattacks, transportation issues, currency fluctuations, product recalls, and government regulatory schemes.\n",
    "  This has affected our profitability and reputation in the past and could do so in the future. While a portion of our commodities are subject\n",
    " to contract pricing, as our contracts expire we may unable to successfully (re)negotiate terms that protect us from inflation or the portion\n",
    " not covered by pricing might increase unexpectedly, creating unplanned price inflation. We experienced 5.5% and 15.2% commodity price\n",
    " inflation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n",
    " If the cost of our ingredients increase, we may suspend or permanently discontinue certain menu items rather than pay the increased cost\n",
    " for the ingredients. These changes to our menu could negatively impact our restaurant traffic and operational results during the shortage\n",
    " and thereafter. Additionally, we may be unable to offset a portion or even all of a future cost increase through menu price increases.\n",
    " Competitive conditions may limit our menu pricing flexibility and implementing menu price increases may change our guests’ visit\n",
    " frequencies or purchasing patterns. Our industry depends on consumer discretionary spending and is affected by changes in consumer\n",
    " tastes, and macro- and micro-economic conditions (including economic downturns, inflation or increased food or energy costs). Factors\n",
    " such as traffic patterns, weather, fuel prices, local demographics, local regulations and the competitive landscape may adversely affect the\n",
    " performances of our individual locations.\n",
    " Our restaurants are primarily located in high-activity trade areas that often contain retail, lifestyle, and entertainment centers. We depend\n",
    " on high visitor rates in these trade areas to attract guests to our restaurants. A decline in traffic at these locations for a sustained period\n",
    " could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations (collectively, \"our Results\").\n",
    " We may fail to open new restaurants or establish new markets or our new restaurants may not perform as well as anticipated,\n",
    " may not be profitable, or may close.\n",
    " Opening and profitably operating new restaurants in existing and new markets is key to our growth. Over the long term, we aim to\n",
    " increase our number of restaurants by approximately 12% to 15% annually. We may struggle to identify target markets, we may not be\n",
    " able to open our planned new restaurants within budget or on a timely basis, and our new restaurants may not perform as well as\n",
    " anticipated. New restaurant success is affected by several factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to secure\n",
    " enough appropriate and attractive sites, and complete construction in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\n",
    " We may open restaurants in geographic markets where we have little or no prior operating experience. Moreover, consumer recognition of\n",
    " our brand has been important to the success of our existing restaurants, and our concept may have limited appeal in new markets.\n",
    " Restaurants in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit and may have higher construction, occupancy and\n",
    " operating costs than existing restaurants. New restaurants in or near markets with existing restaurants could have a material adverse\n",
    " effect on sales at these existing restaurants. Failure on our part to recognize or respond to these challenges may adversely affect the\n",
    " success of new restaurants and could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Some of our restaurants have higher-than-normal sales volumes during the initial startup period, and our Restaurant-Level Adjusted\n",
    " EBITDA Margins are generally lower in the first 12 months of operation. In new markets, the period before average sales stabilize is less\n",
    " predictable because of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers’ limited awareness of our brand. In addition, our AUV and\n",
    " same-restaurant sales may not increase at the rates our existing restaurants have achieved over the past several years. Our ability to\n",
    " operate new restaurants profitably and increase AUV and same-restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond\n",
    " our control.\n",
    " We employ operating and financial targets, but new restaurants may not meet these targets or may take longer than anticipated to do so.\n",
    " If our new restaurants do not perform as planned, it could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Further, our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems (collectively, our\n",
    " “Infrastructure”) may be inadequate to support our planned expansion. We may not enhance our Infrastructure quickly enough or\n",
    " effectively hire, train and retain team members, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results. If we experience a decline in\n",
    " financial performance, we may limit, delay or discontinue restaurant openings, or we may decide to close unprofitable restaurants.\n",
    " Our growth plans and ongoing capital expenditure (\"capex\") needs require us to spend capital, which may not be readily\n",
    " available.\n",
    " Our growth strategy depends on opening new restaurants using cash flows from operations. However, these cash flows may be\n",
    " insufficient to meet our needs. If cash is allocated ineffectively among our projects, or if any initiatives are unsuccessful, we may\n",
    " experience reduced profitability and we may need to delay, limit or eliminate planned restaurant openings, which could have a material\n",
    " adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " As our restaurants mature, they require capital expenditures to remain competitive and maintain our brand standard. If we cannot fund\n",
    " capital expenditures using cash flows from operations, funds will need to be borrowed or otherwise obtained or capex investments will be\n",
    " delayed or eliminated, which could make those restaurants less attractive to guests and materially, adversely affect the business.\n",

    " Our same-restaurant sales may be lower than we expect in future periods.\n",
    " Same-restaurant sales continue to be critical to profitability because their profit margin is generally higher than the profit margin on new\n",
    " restaurant sales. Initiatives to grow same restaurant sales may be unsuccessful, we may miss our targets, or same-restaurant sales could\n",
    " decrease. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Our marketing programs and any limited time or seasonal offerings may be unsuccessful and could fail to meet expectations,\n",
    " and our new menu items, advertising campaigns, heavy reliance on social media and restaurant designs and remodels may not\n",
    " generate increased sales or profits.\n",
    " We incur costs and expend other resources on marketing efforts for new and seasonal menu items, advertising campaigns, and\n",
    " restaurant designs and remodels to raise brand awareness and attract and retain guests. As our restaurant count increases and we\n",
    " expand into new markets, we expect to increase our marketing investment. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, we may incur expenses\n",
    " without the benefit of higher revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Our marketing efforts rely heavily on the use of social media. Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media, and new\n",
    " social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. We must\n",
    " continuously evolve our social media strategies to maintain customer mindshare and brand relevance, particularly given the rise in digital\n",
    " focus among customers. We also invest in other marketing initiatives across digital channels and build customer awareness of,\n",
    " engagement with, and loyalty to our brand. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without higher sales or\n",
    " increased brand recognition.\n",
    " Laws and regulations governing the use of these platforms and devices continue to evolve. The failure by us or our agents to abide by\n",
    " applicable laws and regulations could subject us to investigations, lawsuits, liability, fines or other penalties and have a material adverse\n",
    " effect on our Results. An increase in the use of social media for product promotion and marketing may increase our costs, including those\n",
    " related to compliance, and increase the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims or violate\n",
    " applicable regulations.\n",
    " Incidents involving food-borne illness and food safety could have an adverse effect.\n",
    " Food safety is a top priority and we dedicate substantial resources to help ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products.\n",
    " However, food-borne illnesses and other food safety issues have occurred in the past and could occur in the future. Incidents or reports of\n",
    " food-borne or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, food contamination or tampering, team member hygiene and cleanliness\n",
    " failures, improper team member conduct, or guests spreading illness while at our restaurants could lead to product liability or other claims.\n",

    " takeout or catered events. The risk may affect multiple restaurant locations. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may\n",
    " develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, any of which could give rise to retroactive claims or allegations.\n",
    " One or more food safety instances in one of our restaurants could negatively affect sales at nearby or even all our restaurants, especially\n",

    " Other restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to food-borne illness incidents that have had material adverse impacts on their\n",
    " operations, and it’s possible we could suffer a similar impact if a similar incident occurred at one of our restaurants. Additionally, even if\n",
    " food-borne illnesses were not identified at our restaurants, our restaurant sales could be adversely affected if instances of food-borne\n",
    " illnesses at other restaurant chains were highly publicized.\n",
    " We face significant competition for guests, and our inability to compete effectively may affect our traffic, our sales and our\n",
    " operating profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " The restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete directly and indirectly with national, regional and local limited-service (e.g.,\n",
    " quick service or fast casual) and full-service restaurants on food quality, brand recognition, service, price and value, convenience, design\n",
    " and location. Some competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources, and many are\n",
    " well-established in our target markets. Many of our competitors have greater name recognition locally, regionally, or nationally in these\n",
    " target markets.\n",
    " Our continued success also depends on the popularity of our menu and guest experience. Consumer tastes, nutritional and dietary\n",

    " competitors may react more\n",
    "Portillo's Inc. Form 10-K | 4\n",
    "Table of Contents\n",
    " effectively to changes. In the past, some of our competitors have implemented promotional programs that provide price discounts or\n",
    " reward programs, and they may continue to do so in the future. If we cannot compete effectively, our traffic, restaurant sales and\n",
    " restaurant operating profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results. Should our competitors\n",

    " Our restaurant base is geographically concentrated in the Midwestern United States, and we could be negatively affected by\n",

    " Our restaurants in the Midwestern United States represented approximately 77% of our restaurants as of December 31, 2023. Our\n",
    " restaurants in the Chicagoland area represented approximately 49% of our restaurants as of December 31, 2023. Adverse changes in\n",
    " demographic, unemployment, economic, regulatory or weather conditions in the Midwestern United States have had, and may continue to\n",
    " have, material adverse effects on our Results. As a result of our concentration in this market, we have been, and in the future may be,\n",
    " disproportionately affected by conditions in this geographic area compared to other chain restaurants with a more distributed national\n",
    " footprint.\n",
    " Our competitors could open additional restaurants in the Midwestern United States, which could result in reduced market share for us in\n",
    " this key geographic region, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Damage to our reputation and negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " Our reputation and the perception of our brand are critical to our success. Any incident that erodes our consumer loyalty could\n",
    " significantly damage our business. We may be adversely affected by negative publicity relating to food quality, the safety, sanitation and\n",
    " welfare of our restaurant facilities, guest complaints or litigation, health inspection scores, integrity of our suppliers’ food processing and\n",
    " other policies, practices and procedures, team member relationships and welfare or other matters at one or more of our restaurants.\n",
    " Furthermore, similar negative publicity or occurrences with respect to other restaurants could also decrease our guest traffic and have a\n",
    " similar material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the volume of restaurant commentary has increased dramatically with the\n",
    " proliferation of social media platforms. Negative publicity may adversely affect us or some or all of our restaurants, regardless of whether\n",
    " allegations are valid, and we may not be able to respond effectively. For example, we, or other restaurant companies generally, have and\n",
    " could again come under criticism from animal rights and welfare activists for our business practices or those of our suppliers. Such\n",
    " criticisms could impair our brand, our restaurant sales, our hiring, and our expansion plans. If we changed our practices because of\n",
    " concerns about animal welfare, or in response to such criticisms, our costs might increase, or we may have to change our suppliers or our\n",
    " menu. A similar risk exists with respect to food service businesses unrelated to us if customers mistakenly associate such unrelated\n",
    " businesses with our operations. Team member claims against us based on, among other things, alleged wage and hour violations,\n",
    " discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could\n",
    " adversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources from more productive initiatives. A significant increase in the\n",
    " number of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\n",
    " The digital and delivery business, and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\n",
    " We believe digital investments to be a critical differentiator for our business, driving greater and more frequent engagement with new and\n",
    " existing customers. As the digital space continues to evolve, our technology must also evolve to stay competitive. If we do not maintain\n",

    " Risk Management Philosophy and Strategy\n",
    " As part of our overall risk management strategy, we have increased our attention to cybersecurity. Responsibility for cybersecurity risk\n",
    " management is a team effort, with day-to-day oversight and management from our executive and information technology (\"IT\") teams, the\n",
    " Audit Committee taking a more active role in setting both proactive and reactive strategies and our Board overseeing our efforts and\n",
    " helping to guide our strategy.\n",
    " Our primary source of cybersecurity risk relates to security of our third-party service providers, whose activities and scale may present\n",
    " more desirable targets. However, we do maintain certain systems ourselves and appreciate the need to focus internally as well. We\n",
    " manage cybersecurity risk through a variety of tactics, including (i) the structure of our systems and platforms, (ii) the contractual terms\n",
    " with our third-party vendors, (iii) the proactive vulnerability assessments we conduct (or require our vendors to conduct), (iv) compliance\n",
    " with applicable regulations and continuous improvement around best practices, (v) mitigating user error and human vulnerabilities through\n",
    " training and guidance and (vi) the placement of cybersecurity insurance policies.\n",
    " We employ a “Defense in Depth” strategy to protect the Company, segmenting our systems and networks so that an attack on one\n",
    " segment does not allow for easier compromise of other systems and networks. Within the Company, administrative access to various\n",
    " systems is limited so that there is no universal access if an administrator-level account is compromised.\n",
    " We involve our IT team when negotiating contracts that could increase our cybersecurity risk exposure, so that the team is aware of the\n",
    " specific risks related to a given vendor and can provide feedback and advice on the contractual provisions necessary to prevent a\n",
    " cybersecurity incident, or in the\n",

    " our business and mitigate potential damage. We are continuously improving our processes and contract positions to reflect evolving risks\n",
    " and market practices.\n",
    " We appreciate the need to monitor and test our systems to make sure that they are working the way that they should. We negotiate with\n",
    " our vendors about a variety of monitoring, testing, and reporting provisions so that we can work with them to better address vulnerabilities.\n",
    " This may include sharing SOC 1 or 2 Type 2 audit reports, conducting periodic penetration and vulnerability testing and confirmation that\n",
    " vendors are adhering to applicable laws. We also deploy the same approach internally, and we are currently expanding our testing efforts\n",
    " across our servers and networks, continually monitoring access (including more formal quarterly access reviews for any systems that are\n",
    " subject to SOX oversight), and documenting changes via a ticketing system. In addition to tracking logins, our monitoring system is\n",
    " equipped to respond automatically to certain triggers, taking a range of actions, from notifying administrators to locking out an account.\n",
    " Some of this testing and monitoring is conducted in-house and some is conducted by third-party vendors.\n",
    " As a restaurant and public company, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\"PCI-DSS\") and SOX\n",
    " requirements and we take steps to make sure that we are compliant with those regulations. We also continue to monitor evolving laws\n",
    " and regulations related to security and privacy and look for opportunities to improve our systems based on evolving best practices in the\n",
    " IT industry.\n",
    " We know that people are often the most vulnerable element in an IT ecosystem. We work with team members at all levels to educate\n",
    " them about evolving risks, from well-known tactics and scams (e.g., phishing) to their more sophisticated descendants (e.g., vphishing,\n",
    " spear phishing and smishing). Team members receive training on data security and privacy practices and are included in periodic\n",
    " awareness campaigns to test real-world responses. We are on the lookout for additional training opportunities and have recently begun\n",
    " scheduling “tabletop” exercises to test our PCI-related responses and creating new business interruption plans. The Company also\n",
    " employs and enforces a number of policies to guide team member behavior and help protect against threats, covering everything from\n",
    " regular password updates to obtaining permission to install third-party programs and use personal devices. Team member training\n",
    " reinforces the Company’s risk management policies and procedures and the expectation that all team members will adhere to them.\n",
    " The Company also maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy that we believe is appropriate for a company of our size and risk profile, but\n",
    " it is possible that it may not fully cover the costs associated with a cybersecurity incident.\n",
    " We do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially\n",
    " affected our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, there is no guarantee that a future cybersecurity\n",
    " incident would not materially affect our future strategy, results or financial condition. For a more in-depth discussion of risks associated\n",
    " with cybersecurity and cybersecurity insurance risks , see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\n",
    " Oversight and Execution of Our Cybersecurity Risk Strategy\n",
    " Both the Board and the Audit Committee play an important role in the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee\n",
    " receives periodic updates on the Company’s risk profile and mitigation strategies and conducts forward-looking discussions about major\n",
    " IT changes that are planned, the risks involved and the Company's potential mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee shares updates\n",
    " with the broader Board. We presently have three Directors, Ann Bordelon, Chair of the Audit Committee, Paulette Dodson, and Noah\n",
    " Glass who have cybersecurity risk management experience and we continue to monitor whether supplemental experience may be useful\n",
    " as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve.\n",
    " Day to day management of cybersecurity risk sits with our Vice President of Information Technology (“ITVP”) and his team. As noted\n",
    " above, the team conducts risk assessment activities on a regular basis. The team also liaises with cross-functional partners and outside\n",
    " experts, including legal counsel and consultants, and reviews applicable security frameworks (e.g., National Institute of Standards and\n",
    " Technology (\"NIST\")) to identify the legal requirements and industry practices and expectations that the Company’s security measures\n",
    " should satisfy. The Company regularly updates its practices to incorporate new best practices and strengthen compliance with SOX,\n",
    " PCI-DSS and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements. These activities are used to develop and update the\n",
    " Company’s cybersecurity risk profile.\n",
    " The team then identifies the potential mitigation measures to address these risks, and may bring in consultants as appropriate based on\n",
    " their expertise and knowledge of the Company to develop strategies that are tailored to the Company’s needs and profile. These\n",
    " measures include business continuity plans (which are developed in connection with our risk management team and the users of a given\n",
    " platform), improving system redundancy to limit disruptions and eliminating single points of failure where possible.\n",
    " In addition to our ITVP, the cybersecurity portion of our IT team includes one dedicated team member and four additional team members\n",
    " who handle cybersecurity risks in addition to other job responsibilities. To address any gaps in the Company’s collective expertise and to\n",
    " account for the ever-evolving nature of cybersecurity risks, the Company retains various consultants as noted above. The internal and\n",

    " Officer and updates her on a weekly basis. Our Chief Financial Officer discusses IT matters, including security, during weekly executive\n",
    " leadership meetings and may call upon the ITVP periodically to report directly to the team. Following these meetings, the ITVP works with\n",
    " his team to address any feedback received. Cybersecurity and privacy objectives are built into the ITVP’s annual objectives and those of\n",

    " Detecting and Responding to a Cybersecurity Incident\n",
    " As noted previously, both we and our vendors (to the extent contractually required) monitor systems for potential incidents. We are\n",
    " working with our vendors to determine the applicable warning flags and thresholds and appropriate notification processes based on the\n",
    " services provided and type of data processed.\n",
    " In the event of a cybersecurity incident, whether the attack is on the Company or on a third-party service provider, the IT team conducts\n",
    " an initial assessment to estimate the scope and potential impact of the attack. The team also identifies critical information yet to be\n",
    " determined. A cross-functional team meets about the results of the initial assessment, including the nature and scope of the attack, which\n",
    " Company functions are affected, the response from the service provider (if a third-party incident), both financial and non-financial\n",
    " measures of materiality, the expected duration of the incident, any open or unknown information, and the status of the Company’s\n",
    " response.\n",
    " Following the initial briefing, depending on the seriousness of the incident, a cadence for updates and escalation is established and the\n",
    " cross-functional team continues to investigate, mitigate and resolve the incident, retaining outside counsel, forensic investigators and\n",

    " Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n",
    " We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Portillo’s Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023,\n",
    " based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\n",

    " 27, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n",
    " Basis for Opinion\n",
    " The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\n",
    " effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over\n",
    " Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\n",
    " audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\n",

    " the PCAOB.\n",
    " We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\n",

    " Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n",
    " A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\n",
    " financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\n",
    " principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\n",
    " of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\n",
    " provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\n",
    " with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\n",
    " authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n",
    " detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\n",
    " statements.\n",
    " Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\n",
    " any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\n",
    " conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n",

    "NOTE 1.     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n",
    " Portillo’s Inc. (\"Inc.\") was formed and incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 8, 2021. Inc. was formed for the purpose of\n",
    " completing an initial public offering (\"IPO\") and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the \"Transactions”) in order to carry on the\n",
    " business of PHD Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (\"Portillo's OpCo\"). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October\n",
    " 20, 2021, Inc. became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo, and a s sole managing member, Inc. operates and controls all of the\n",
    " business and affairs of Portillo's OpCo. As a result, Inc. consolidates the financial results of Portillo's OpCo and reports a non-controlling\n",
    " interest representing the economic interest in Portillo's OpCo held by the other members of Portillo's OpCo (the \"pre-IPO LLC Members\").\n",
    " Unless the context otherwise requires, references to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"Portillo's,\" and the \"Company\" refer to Portillo's Inc. and its\n",
    " subsidiaries, including Portillo's OpCo.\n",
    " The Company operates fast-casual restaurants in 10 states, along with two food production commissaries in Illinois. As of December 31,\n",
    " 2023 and December 25, 2022, the Company had 83 and 71 restaurants in operation, respectively). The Company also had two\n",
    " non-traditional locations in operation as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022. These non-traditional locations include a food\n",
    " truck and a ghost kitchen (small kitchen with no store-front presence, used to fill online orders). Portillo's Inc., additionally has a 50 %\n",
    " interest in a single restaurant owned by C&O, which is excluded from the Company's restaurant count. The Company’s principal corporate\n",
    " offices are located in Oak Brook, Illinois.\n",
    " Initial Public Offering\n",
    " The Company's registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-259810), related to its IPO was declared effective\n",
    " October 20, 2021, and the Company's Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol\n",
    " \"PTLO\" on October 21, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Company completed its IPO of 23,310,810 shares of the Company's Class A\n",
    " common stock ( including 3,040,540 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) , at an offering price of $ 20.00\n",
    " per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $ 430.0  million after deducting underwriting discounts and\n",
    " commissions of $ 29.1  million and other offering expenses of approximately $ 7.1  million.\n",
    " In connection with the IPO, we completed the following:\n",
    " • We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of Portillo’s OpCo (\"LLC Agreement\") to, among other things,\n",
    " convert all outstanding equity interests (except for those redeemable preferred units which were redeemed in connection with the\n",
    " IPO) into LLC Units.\n",
    " • We became the sole managing member of Portillo's OpCo. Because we manage and operate the business and control the\n",
    " strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Portillo’s OpCo and because we also have a substantial financial interest in\n",
    " Portillo’s OpCo, we consolidated the financial results of Portillo’s OpCo, and a portion of our net income was allocated to\n",
    " non-controlling interests to reflect the entitlement of the pre-IPO LLC Members who retained their equity ownership in Portillo's\n",
    " OpCo. In addition, because Portillo’s OpCo was under the common control of the pre-IPO LLC Members before and after the\n",
    " Transactions, we measured the assets and liabilities of Portillo’s OpCo at their carrying amounts as of the date of the completion\n",
    " of the Transactions.\n",
    " • We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to authorize the issuance of two series of common stock: Class A\n",
    " common stock and Class B common stock. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitles its holder to\n",
    " one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. The Class B common stock is not entitled to economic\n",
    " interests in Portillo’s Inc.\n",
    " The net proceeds and cash on hand were used as follows:\n",
    " • to repay the redeemable preferred units in full (including the redemption premium) of $ 221.7  million;\n",
    " • to repay all of the borrowings outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (including any prepayment penalties) of $\n",
    " 158.1  million; and\n",
    " • to purchase LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock or shares of Class A common stock from certain\n",

    " NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n",
    " In connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") with certain pre-IPO LLC Members, in which\n",
    " the Company will be generally obligated to pay 85 % of the amount of applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, and local\n",
    " income tax that the Company actually realizes or is deemed to realize as a result of (i) our allocable share of existing tax basis in\n",
    " depreciable or amortizable assets relating to LLC Units acquired in the IPO, (ii) certain favorable tax attributes acquired by the Company\n",
    " from entities treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes that held LLC Units prior to the Transactions (\"Blocker Companies\") (including\n",
    " net operating losses and the Blocker Companies' allocable share of existing tax basis), (iii) increases in our allocable share of then\n",
    " existing tax basis in depreciable or amortizable assets, and adjustments to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets, of Portillo’s\n",
    " OpCo and its subsidiaries, as a result of (x) sales or exchanges of interests in Portillo’s OpCo (including the repayment of the redeemable\n",
    " preferred units) in connection with the IPO and (y) future or exchanges of LLC Units by pre-IPO LLC Members for Class A common stock\n",
    " and (iv) certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including payments made under the TRA. We will retain the benefit of\n",
    " the remaining 15 % of these tax savings. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of\n",
    " future taxable income over the term of the TRA and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the\n",
    " aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA payments.\n",
    " Secondary Offerings\n",
    " In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock at\n",
    " an offering price of $ 21.05 per share. On April 5, 2023, the Underwriter exercised its overallotment option in part, to purchase an\n",
    " additional 620,493 shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an offering price of $ 21.05 per share (collectively the \"Q1 2023\n",
    " Secondary Offering and Overallotment Option\"). We used all of the net proceeds from the Q1 2023 Secondary Offering and Overallotment\n",
    " Option to purchase LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock from certain pre-IPO LLC Members and to repurchase\n",
    " shares of Class A common stock from the Blocker Companies at a price per LLC Unit or share of Class A common stock, as applicable,\n",
    " equal to the public offering price per share of Class A common stock, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The proceeds\n",
    " from the Q1 2023 Secondary Offering and Overallotment Option were used to (i) purchase 2,269,776 existing shares of Class A common\n",
    " stock from the shareholders of the Blocker Companies and (ii) redeem 6,350,717 LLC Units held by the pre-IPO LLC Members. In\n",
    " connection with the redemption, 6,350,717 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the pre-IPO LLC Members and\n",
    " canceled, and the Company received 6,350,717 newly-issued LLC Units, increasing the Company's total ownership interest in Portillo's\n",
    " OpCo. As a result, Portillo’s did not receive any proceeds from the offering, and the total number of shares of Class A common stock and\n",
    " Class B common stock did not change; however, the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock increased by the same\n",
    " number of the canceled shares of Class B common stock.\n",
    " In the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company completed two secondary offerings of 8,066,458 shares (including 66,458 shares\n",
    " sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) and 8,000,000 shares, respectively, of the Company's Class A common\n",
    " stock at an offering price of $ 23.75 and $ 22.69 , respectively, per share.\n",
    " As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 76.1 % of Portillo's OpCo and the pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 23.9 % of\n",

    " The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\n",
    " the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\n",
    " transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n",
    " The Company does not have any components of other comprehensive income (loss) recorded within its consolidated financial statements,\n",

    " Segment Reporting\n",
    " The Company owns and operates fast-casual restaurants in the United States, along with two food production commissaries in Illinois.\n",
    " The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). As the CODM reviews financial\n",
    " performance and allocates resources at a consolidated level on a recurring basis, the Company has one operating segment and one\n",
    " reportable segment.\n",
    " Use of Estimates\n",
    " The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\n",
    " assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\n",
    " financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n",
    " Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n",
    " Cash includes amounts that are either held in the Company’s bank accounts or represent deposits in transit. Amounts receivable from\n",
    " credit card processors are considered cash equivalents because they are both short in term and highly liquid in nature and are typically\n",
    " converted to cash within three business days of the sales transactions.\n",
    " Restricted cash includes amounts that are held in the Company’s bank accounts subject to minimum balance requirements for medical\n",
    " claim disbursements.\n",
    " Accounts and Tenant Improvement Receivables\n",
    " Accounts and tenant improvement receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates, tenant improvement receivables, and delivery\n",
    " receivables as well as receivables from related parties (see Note 17. Related Party Transactions). The Company evaluates the\n",
    " collectability of its Accounts and tenant improvement receivables based on a variety of factors, including historical experience, current and\n",
    " future economic and market conditions and other factors. Based on these factors, no allowance for uncollectible accounts was recorded at\n",
    " December 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022.\n",
    " Inventory\n",
    " Inventory, which consists mainly of food products, is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in,\n",
    " first-out (FIFO) method. No other adjustment is deemed necessary to reduce inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value due to the\n",
    " rapid turnover and high utilization of inventory.\n",
    " The Company operates two commissaries to supply the Company's restaurants with several products and ensures product consistency\n",
    " and quality. The commissaries derive revenue principally from the sale and distribution of food to our distributors, who, in turn, sell the\n",
    " food to the restaurants. This is considered under ASC 845, Non-Monetary Transactions, and the impact on the statement of operations is\n",
    " not material. These products are held as inventory at distributors on a short-term consignment basis. Inventories subject to these\n",
    " consignment arrangements are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and were $ 0.9  million and $ 0.7  million as of\n",
    " December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\n",
    " Equity Method Investment\n",
    " The Company has a 50 % interest in C&O. The Company accounts for the investment and financial results in the consolidated financial\n",
    " statements under the equity method of accounting as the Company has significant influence but does not have control. The investment is\n",
    " adjusted to reflect the Company’s share of C&O’s earnings and losses to date and any distributions received.\n",
    " Long-Lived Assets and Valuation\n",
    " The Company’s long-lived assets include property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization are\n",
    " computed using the straight-line method. Except for leasehold improvements, depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of\n",
    " each asset (generally ranging from three to ten years ). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated lives of\n",

    " NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n",
    " The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and operating lease assets\n",
    " for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group might not be\n",
    " recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to\n",
    " be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is\n",
    " recognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Restaurant-level assets are grouped by restaurant\n",
    " for the purpose of the impairment assessment because a restaurant represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\n",
    " largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. No impairment charge was recorded for any period presented.\n",
    " Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\n",
    " Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events and\n",
    " circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its carrying\n",
    " value. The Company has one reporting unit which is evaluated for impairment annually. Fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using\n",
    " the market approach that uses publicly available market data, including publicly traded stock prices and total shares outstanding to\n",
    " determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is\n",
    " recorded for the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit.\n",
    " The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks (collectively “trade names”). The Company\n",
    " estimates the fair value of its trade names using a relief-from-royalty income approach. If the fair value of the trade name is less than its\n",
    " carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible\n",
    " assets.\n",
    " Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n",
    " The Company discloses and recognizes the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation\n",
    " techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\n",
    " liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes three\n",
    " levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n",
    " Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n",
    " Level 2 - Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for\n",
    " identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\n",
    " observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n",
    " Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little\n",
    " or no market data.\n",
    " Offering Costs\n",
    " In connection with the IPO, Portillo's OpCo incurred certain legal, accounting, and other IPO-related costs. Such costs are recorded in\n",
    " stockholders’ equity as a reduction from the proceeds of the offering. As of December 26, 2021, $ 7.1  million of offering costs had been\n",
    " recorded in stockholders' equity.\n",
    " Revenue Recognition\n",
    " Revenues from retail restaurants are presented net of discounts and recognized when food and beverage products are sold to the end\n",
    " customer. Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and the obligation is included in accrued liabilities until the\n",
    " taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities.\n",
    " The Company also offers delivery services to its customers. Delivery sales are generally fulfilled by third-party delivery partners whether\n",
    " ordered through the Portillo's app and website (\"Dispatch Sales\") or through third-party delivery partners (\"Marketplace Sales\"). Dispatch\n",
    " Sales include delivery and service fees as the Company controls the delivery. Revenue from Dispatch Sales is recognized when food is\n",
    " delivered to the customer. For these sales, the Company receives payment directly from the customer at the time of sale. Revenue for\n",
    " Marketplace Sales is recognized in the amount paid to the delivery partner by the customer for food and excludes delivery and service\n",
    " fees charged by the third-party delivery partner as the Company does not control the delivery. Revenue from Marketplace Sales is\n",
    " recognized when food is delivered to the\n",

    " customer. For these sales, the Company receives payment from the delivery partner subsequent to the transfer of order, which is\n",
    " generally paid one week in arrears. For all delivery sales of food, the Company is considered the principal and recognizes revenue on a\n",
    " gross basis.\n",
    " Generally, revenue is recognized as promised goods or services transfer to the guest or customer in an amount that reflects the\n",
    " consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at\n",
    " the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Refer to Note 3. Revenue Recognition for additional detail.\n",
    " Commitments\n",
    " The majority of the food products the Company purchases are subject to changes in price primarily due to the effect of supply and\n",
    " demand of the commodities, in particular, proteins, dairy, produce and grains. Overall pricing agreements are established in an effort to\n",
    " maintain a more consistent food cost without creating long-term purchase commitments.\n",
    " Employee Benefits\n",
    " The Company sponsors a 401(k) plan for all employees that are eligible based upon age and length of service. The expenses incurred for\n",
    " Company matching contributions to the plan were approximately $ 0.4  million, $ 0.4  million and $ 0.5 million for the years ended\n",
    " December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.\n",
    " The Company offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain officers and other members of management. Under the plan,\n",
    " eligible employees may defer up to 80 % of their annual salary and annual bonus. The Company has elected to fund its deferred\n",
    " compensation obligations through a rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but such assets are\n",
    " not available for general corporate purposes. Assets held in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, which are purchased and held\n",
    " principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term, and are classified as trading securities and carried at fair value.\n",
    " Equity-Based Compensation\n",
    " The Company has issued non-qualified stock options, performance-based stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock\n",
    " awards. Equity-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant-date fair value of those awards and is recognized on a\n",

    " contracts to determine whether the contract involves the use of property or equipment, which is either explicitly or implicitly identified. We\n",
    " evaluate whether we control the use of the asset, which is determined by assessing whether we obtain substantially all economic benefits\n",

    " particular form and conditions of each award to be granted. Under the 2014 Plan, the number of shares and exercise price of each option\n",
    " were determined by the board of managers, or a committee designated by the board of managers. The awards granted were generally\n",
    " exercisable within a 10-year period from the date of grant.\n",
    " The unit option grants were equally divided between (i) options subject to time-based vesting, and (ii) options subject to both time-based\n",
    " and performance-based vesting. The time-based vesting options vest, in general, in equal annual installments over a 5-year period and\n",
    " have a 10-year term from the date of the grant. The options subject to both time-based and performance-based vesting have a ten-year\n",
    " term from the date of the grant and vest, in general, in equal annual installments over a 5-year period from the date of grant, subject to\n",
    " acceleration in the event of a sale transaction, and have a performance condition that is satisfied upon achievement of a specified internal\n",
    " rate of return and a minimum multiple of invested capital. In connection with the IPO, the performance condition was waived and all such\n",
    " options became subject to time-based vesting only. As a result of the waiver and resultant modification in the terms of the performance\n",

    " approximately $ 26.2 million , each at the modification date in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 .\n",
    " In connection with the IPO, each option outstanding under the 2014 Plan, whether vested or unvested, was substituted for an option to\n",
