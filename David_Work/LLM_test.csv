Commodity and Food Price Risks
We are exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are
commodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our
control and include raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets and global supply and demand
dynamics, among other items. In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter
into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous.","Yes, the context provided is very useful. It provides insight into Portillo's Inc.'s approach to managing profitability amidst rising food costs, specifically by highlighting their exposure to commodity price risks.

This approach is often referred to as hedging or risk management, where companies take steps to reduce their exposure to price fluctuations in order to maintain stability and profitability.

2022, an increase of $19.5 million or 12.6%. This increase was primarily driven by the opening of twelve restaurants in the year ended
December 31, 2023 and the opening of three restaurants in 2022, and incremental investments to support our team members, including
annual rate increases, and higher variable-based compensation. As a percentage of revenues, net, labor decreased 0.7% during the year
ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in our average check, partially offset by the aforementioned incremental hourly
rate increases to support our team members, lower transactions, and higher labor utilization. Occupancy Expenses
Occupancy expenses primarily consist of rent, property insurance and property taxes.","Yes, the context you provided was helpful in understanding Portillo's plan to manage labor costs. Here are some points that stood out:

1. **Year-over-year increase**: The increase in labor expenses from $154.4 million to $173.9 million is a significant 12.6% rise. This suggests that Labor Department closures, and the resulting wage inflation, are having an impact on Portillo's bottom line.
2. **Factors influencing labor costs**: You correctly identified four key factors that influence labor costs: wage inflation, payroll tax legislation, health care costs, and staffing needs. These factors will likely continue to affect labor expenses in future years.
3. **Impact of opening twelve new restaurants**: The opening of 12 new restaurants is mentioned as a contributing factor to the increase in labor expenses. This suggests that additional staffing requirements may be necessary to meet increased demand for Portillo's expanded operations.
4. **Annual rate increases and higher variable-based compensation**: Portillo's use of annual rate increases and higher variable-based compensation to support team members likely contributes to the incremental increases in labor costs.
5. **Net labor expense decrease as a percentage of revenues**: The 0.7% net labor expense decrease, primarily due to an increase in average check prices and lower transactions, suggests that Portillo's labor expenses are being managed effectively within their overall revenue growth.

Overall, the context provided provides valuable insights into the factors influencing labor costs at Portillo's and how they may impact future labor expense planning."
15,How does Portillo’s handle seasonal fluctuations in its business?,"Portillo’s experiences nominally higher revenues in the second, third, and fourth quarters of the year, with variations due to the timing of new restaurant openings and pre-opening expenses.

Fiscal 2023 Highlights
Our fiscal 2023 financial highlights include:
• Total revenue increased 15.8% or $92.8 million to $679.9 million; this increase is inclusive of the favorable impact of the 53rd
week, which resulted in incremental revenue of approximately $13.9 million. • Same-restaurant sales* increased 5.7%.","The context provided seems to be about Portillo's business operations and financial performance for Fiscal 2023. However, I'd like to clarify a few points to better understand your question.

From what you've shared, it appears that Portillo's operates in a seasonal manner, with six operating days during the 53rd week of fiscal 2023, which is Christmas Day. This suggests that the business may experience fluctuations in sales and revenue due to the holidays.

Given this context, here are some potential ways that Portillo's might handle seasonal fluctuations:

1. **Adjusting staffing and operations**: During slower periods like Christmas Day, Portillo's might reduce staff or adjust their operating hours to minimize costs and ensure a better customer experience.
2. **Marketing and promotions**: To capitalize on the increased demand during holidays, Portillo's could run targeted marketing campaigns, offer special deals, or create promotional content to attract customers.
3. **Menu adjustments**: During slower periods, restaurants might offer limited menu items or promotions to encourage sales during busier times.
4. **Supply chain management**: Portillo's may need to manage their supply chain more efficiently to ensure that ingredients and products are available for peak demand periods like Christmas Day.

To answer your question directly: How does Portillo's handle seasonal fluctuations in its business?

Portillo's likely employs a combination of these strategies to adapt to changing sales patterns throughout the year."
16,What was the impact of Portillo’s initial public offering (IPO) and secondary offerings?,"Portillo’s completed its IPO in October 2021, raising significant capital. In Q1 2023, Portillo’s also conducted a secondary offering, using proceeds to redeem LLC units from pre-IPO LLC members and repurchase shares, thereby increasing its ownership of Portillo’s OpCo to 76.1%.","Inc. was formed for the purpose of
completing an initial public offering (""IPO"") and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the ""Transactions”) in order to carry on the
business of PHD Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (""Portillo's OpCo""). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October
20, 2021, Inc. became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo, and a s sole managing member, Inc. operates and controls all of the
business and affairs of Portillo's OpCo. As a result, Inc. consolidates the financial results of Portillo's OpCo and reports a non-controlling
interest representing the economic interest in Portillo's OpCo held by the other members of Portillo's OpCo (the ""pre-IPO LLC Members""). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" ""Portillo's,"" and the ""Company"" refer to Portillo's Inc. and its
subsidiaries, including Portillo's OpCo. The Company operates fast-casual restaurants in 10 states, along with two food production commissaries in Illinois.","The context provided gives a clear overview of the events leading up to Portillo's initial public offering (IPO) and secondary offerings. Here's a summary of what I've gathered:

- In October 2021, PHD Group Holdings LLC completed an IPO and related reorganization transactions, forming Inc., which became the sole managing member of Portillo's OpCo.
- As a result, Inc. consolidated Portillo's OpCo and reported a non-controlling interest representing the economic interest in Portillo's OpCo held by other members (pre-IPO LLC Members).
- The pre-IPO LLC Members include various parties that had previously invested or participated in Portillo's business, such as employees, suppliers, or investors.

To assess the impact of these events on Portillo's operations and finances, let's consider a few points:

1. Consolidation: By becoming the sole managing member of Portillo's OpCo, Inc. has consolidated the financial results of the company and reports its economic interest in Portillo's OpCo as a non-controlling interest.
2. Reporting structure: This consolidation may have affected the reporting structure of Portillo's financial statements, potentially leading to more complex or nuanced disclosures about the company's operations and finances.
3. Ownership and control: The fact that Inc. operates and controls all business and affairs of Portillo's OpCo suggests a shift in ownership dynamics and potential changes to governance structures.

However, without additional information on specific events, trends, or outcomes following these IPO and secondary offerings, it's difficult to provide a more detailed analysis of the impact on Portillo's operations and finances. If you have any further questions or would like me to explore specific aspects of this topic in more detail, feel free to ask!"

Additionally, their focus on fast-casual and quick-service concepts suggests that they are well-positioned to compete with other casual dining chains.

However, there are a few potential areas where Portillo's might be managing competition:

1. Menu offerings: While Portillo's menu features iconic Chicago street food items, it may not offer anything entirely unique or innovative compared to other fast-casual options.
2. Pricing: The text does not provide any information on pricing strategies, which can impact the competitiveness of Portillo's in terms of attracting customers.
3. Market positioning: While Portillo's has a strong brand identity and loyal following, it may not be aggressively positioned as a premium or luxury dining experience, which could make them less competitive with high-end restaurants.

commodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our
control and include raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets and global supply and demand

19,How has Portillo’s addressed rising wage costs and labor shortages?,"Portillo’s has focused on improving operational efficiency to manage rising labor costs and offers competitive wages to attract and retain employees. They also prioritize leadership development, flexible scheduling, and team member engagement to mitigate labor shortages and reduce turnover.","Factors that influence labor costs include wage inflation and payroll tax legislation, health care costs

3. **Staffing needs**: The need to open new restaurants and invest in team members suggests that Portillo's faces significant staffing challenges, which contributes to higher labor expenses.
4. **Rising wage costs as the primary driver of increased labor expenses**: The significant increase in labor expenses (19.5% YoY) is primarily attributed to the opening of 12 new restaurants and three additional locations, followed by incremental investments in staff.
5. **Labor utilization rates decreasing**: The decrease in labor utilization rates from 1.9 hours per employee per day in 2022 to 1.8 hours per employee per day in 2023 suggests that Portillo's is working efficiently with their employees.

connection with the redemption, 6,350,717 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the pre-IPO LLC Members and
canceled, and the Company received 6,350,717 newly-issued LLC Units, increasing the Company's total ownership interest in Portillo's
OpCo. As a result, Portillo’s did not receive any proceeds from the offering, and the total number of shares of Class A common stock and
Class B common stock did not change; however, the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock increased by the same
number of the canceled shares of Class B common stock. In the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company completed two secondary offerings of 8,066,458 shares (including 66,458 shares
sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) and 8,000,000 shares, respectively, of the Company's Class A common
stock at an offering price of $ 23.75 and $ 22.69 , respectively, per share. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 76.1 % of Portillo's OpCo and the pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 23.9 % of

3. **Limited loyalty program**: A robust rewards program or loyalty card could encourage repeat business and foster customer retention.
4. **Seasonal menu offerings**: The absence of seasonal menu items may limit Portillo's ability to keep the menu fresh and exciting for customers who crave new flavors.
5. **Price sensitivity**: While their iconic sandwiches are a draw, some customers might be deterred by higher prices compared to fast-casual chains.

To address these challenges and stay competitive in the market:

1. **Improve online ordering and delivery**: Invest in technology to enhance the customer experience, making it easier for them to order and track their food.
2. **Expand delivery options**: Consider partnering with third-party delivery services or developing a mobile app that enables customers to order from the restaurant's online platform.

Commodity and Food Price Risks
We are exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are
commodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our
control and include raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets and global supply and demand
dynamics, among other items. In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter
into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous.","The provided context is indeed useful in understanding the potential risks associated with Portillo's growth strategy.

The key points from this section are:

1. Portillo's Inc. is exposed to commodity price risks, which include factors such as raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets, and global supply and demand dynamics.
2. These risks can impact the availability of ingredients and packaging materials, potentially affecting the quality and consistency of their food products.
3. To mitigate these risks, Portillo's has taken steps to monitor primary commodities and enter into purchasing contracts when advantageous.

Some potential risks associated with these commodity price fluctuations include:

* Changes in ingredient prices or availability
* Fluctuations in packaging material costs
* Disruptions to global supply chains
* Economic downturns that affect demand for food products

By monitoring commodity prices and entering into purchasing contracts, Portillo's aims to minimize the impact of these risks on its operations. However, it is essential to continue monitoring market conditions to stay ahead of potential price fluctuations.

In the context of a growth strategy, this highlights several key considerations:

* Diversification: Maintaining a diverse portfolio of ingredients and suppliers can help mitigate the risk of single-point failures.
* Supply chain management: Effective supply chain management can help reduce the impact of disruptions to global supply chains.
* Innovation: Continuously innovating and adapting to changing market conditions can enable Portillo's to stay competitive and responsive to customer needs.
* Risk management: Implementing robust risk management strategies can help Portillo's navigate potential challenges and capitalize on opportunities."

Menu enhancements like the Rodeo Burger also contributed to higher average check amounts.","We believe unit growth is a key driver of shareholder value creation. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we opened 12 new
restaurants in the Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Texas markets for a total of 84 restaurants, including a restaurant owned by C&O. In 2023,
we made significant strides in Texas with the opening of four new restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. The three restaurants
opened in fiscal 2022 and 12 restaurants opened in fiscal 2023 positively impacted revenues by approximately $48.4 million in the year
ended December 31, 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to see commodity inflation stabilize versus 2022 levels.","The question seems to be asking about Portillo's same-restaurant sales growth in 2023, but it appears there is a minor error in the text: ""fiscal"" should be spelled as ""fiscal"". Here's my analysis:

In 2023, Portillo's opened 12 new restaurants, adding 84 new locations to its total (including one owned by C&O). The same-restaurant sales growth can be inferred from the following points:

1. Unit growth is a key driver of shareholder value creation.

3. This growth led to a significant increase in revenues by approximately $48.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023.

These points suggest that Portillo's same-restaurant sales grew due to the following factors:

* Increased number of restaurants, potentially leading to higher sales per unit
* Stabilization or stabilization (not specified) of commodity inflation, which could have contributed to cost savings and improved profitability

Overall, it appears that the opening of new restaurants was a key driver of Portillo's same-restaurant sales growth in 2023."

changes in our team member count and costs related to strategic and growth initiatives. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $78.8 million compared to $66.9 million for the year
ended December 25, 2022, an increase of $11.9 million or 17.9%. This increase was primarily driven by higher variable-based

beverage control regulations generally require our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal
authorities for an annual license that may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact
many parts of restaurant operations, including minimum age of team members, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing,
inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages and training.","The context provided is helpful in understanding how Portillo's Inc. addresses environmental regulations in its restaurant operations.

According to the text, when a relocated restaurant is established, revenues and profit may not be equal to those generated at the existing restaurant due to differences in operating costs, marketing expenses, and other factors.

In terms of addressing environmental regulations, it appears that Portillo's Inc. is taking a proactive approach by:

1. Ensuring compliance with state authority licensing requirements for serving alcoholic beverages.
2. Implementing policies and procedures related to minimum age of team members, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, handling, storage, and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.

These measures are likely aimed at minimizing the risk of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and avoiding potential fines or penalties. By having a clear understanding of these regulations and implementing effective controls, Portillo's can ensure that its operations comply with environmental laws and regulations.

However, it is worth noting that the text does not provide specific details on the costs associated with complying with environmental regulations, such as increased labor costs, inventory management expenses, or marketing expenses.

into purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous.","The context provided is indeed helpful. Here's a breakdown of the challenges Portillo's Inc. might face when entering new geographic markets:

1. **Commodity price risks**: As you mentioned, Portillo's uses commodities or ingredients that are affected by external factors like raw material inputs, weather conditions, currency markets, and global supply and demand dynamics. This means they need to closely monitor these prices to minimize their impact.
2. **Limited control over commodity prices**: The company is not in control of the fluctuations in price for these commodities. This limits their ability to negotiate favorable terms or adjust production levels quickly in response to changes.
3. **Monitoring and entering into purchasing contracts**: To mitigate these risks, Portillo's may need to:
	* Continuously monitor commodity markets to identify potential price increases or decreases.
	* Enter into purchasing contracts with suppliers that offer competitive pricing and favorable terms.
	* Develop relationships with reliable suppliers who can provide consistent quality and supply.
4. **Risk of food product shortages**: If the company fails to purchase commodities at optimal prices, they may experience shortages in their products, which could impact customer demand and sales.
5. **Logistical challenges**: Entering new markets can also require significant investments in logistics, transportation, and inventory management, which can be complex and costly.

By understanding these challenges, Portillo's Inc. can better prepare themselves to navigate the complexities of entering new geographic markets and minimize potential risks."

This would enable customers to easily order from Portillo's restaurants using their preferred delivery services.

6. **Expanded Delivery and Catering Options**: Considering the rise of meal kit services and food delivery apps, Portillo's may consider expanding its catering and off-premise offerings to include more flexible and convenient options for customers who prefer to pick up or have food delivered without a sit-down experience.

From the provided notes to the consolidated financial statements, it appears that Portillo's Inc., a fast-casual restaurant chain, reported a mixed performance in 2023. Here are some key points:

1. **Revenue from gift card sales**: The company recognized revenue of $6.97 million and $7.39 million from gift card sales in December 2022 and December 2021, respectively. This indicates that gift cards were a significant contributor to their revenue.
2. **Redemption of gift cards**: In December 2023, the company received $3.82 million in revenue from redemption of gift cards that were not yet redeemed. However, this amount was included in the gift card liability balance, which is expected to be paid out over time.
3. **Net income and cash flow**: Portillo's reported net income of $1.9 million in December 2022 and $5.4 million in December 2023. The company also had a negative cash flow from operating activities due to various expenses, including inventory levels that were higher than anticipated.

Considering these points, it seems that Portillo's struggled with managing cash flow and profitability in 2023 due to several factors:

* High inventory levels: Inventory was higher than expected, which may have led to increased costs for supplies, labor, and other expenses.
* Gift card liability: The company had a significant gift card liability balance at the beginning of the year, which was not fully settled until December 2023. This could be a potential source of cash flow issues in future periods.
* Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher than expected in 2023, indicating that the company may have had to write off more assets or write down the value of certain investments.

To improve their financial performance, Portillo's may need to:

* Manage inventory levels more effectively
* Reduce costs associated with gift cards, such as discounts and promotions
* Monitor cash flow closely to ensure it is adequate to meet short-term obligations, such as payment for supplies and employees.
* Consider reducing or eliminating gift card redemption fees to reduce operating expenses.

Overall, the context provided suggests that Portillo's had a challenging year in terms of managing cash flow and profitability due to various factors, but with careful planning and management, they may be able to improve their financial performance in future years."
