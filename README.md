### Our Company
Mosaic is an early start-up founded by Booth MBA student Jackson Finks, a long time portfolio manager and Director of Investor Relations, to build a bridge between publicly traded companies and stakeholders.

### Our Idea
Build a platform where investors can ask questions and get informed about the current situation of publicly traded companies. Facilitate the access to public information that is long to analyze by hand.
