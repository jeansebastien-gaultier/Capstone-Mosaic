recorded when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and amounts are recorded in earnings as the expenses in which the incentive is meant to offset are
incurred, as we meet the conditions of the grant or as the capital investment is depreciated. At December 31, 2022, cash incentives receivable in Accounts
and notes receivable, net of allowance was $300 million, cash incentives receivable in Other assets was $248 million and deferred incentive income in Other

9,How does GM approach sustainability and environmental responsibility?,"GM is committed to reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy use, and aiming for carbon neutrality by 2040. The company also plans to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new U.S. light-duty vehicles by 2035.","We also announced that we anticipate our total annual capital spending and our investments in our battery cell
manufacturing joint ventures to be in the range of $11.0 to $13.0 billion through 2025 primarily to accelerate this transformation plan. Industrial Environmental Control Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions,
water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions
regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as
well as liability for related damages to natural resources. To further mitigate the impacts of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are supplementing our compliance
programs with sustainability efforts focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and operational waste."
10,What are General Motors’ plans for hydrogen fuel cell technology?,"GM is developing hydrogen fuel cell applications, called HYDROTEC, for various industries, including transportation, mobile power, and aerospace, collaborating with Honda to commercialize these technologies.","GM and Honda,
through our
2Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
long-term strategic alliance to collaborate in research and advanced engineering efforts, are developing and commercializing fuel cell systems. In 2021, we
announced a number of commercial relationships and, in November 2022, we announced a joint development agreement with Nel Hydrogen US to help
enable cost competitive renewable hydrogen production. OnStar Insurance Services OnStar Insurance is currently available in all 50 states. This innovative startup leverages GM's expertise in data and vehicle
technology to learn, scale and move the company forward. As technology evolves, OnStar Insurance expects to transform traditional models to make the
insurance process easier, smarter and more personalized for customers."
11,What factors affect GM's vehicle sales?,"Factors include vehicle design, pricing, safety, and fuel economy. GM also faces competition from both traditional automakers and new entrants, impacting its sales strategies and incentives.","GMNA Industry sales in North America were 17.3 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 6.6% compared to the
corresponding period in 2021. U.S. industry sales were 14.2 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 7.9% compared
to the corresponding period in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that
continued through 2022. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size SUVs. Our total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.3 million units for a market share of 16.0% in the year ended December
31, 2022, representing an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2021."

material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material suppliers. The terms of these offtake agreements may obligate us to purchase defined
quantities of output over a specified period of time, subject to certain conditions. If we are unable to utilize or otherwise monetize the raw materials we are
obligated to purchase under these offtake agreements, it could materially adversely affect our cash flows and increase our inventory. In addition, many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as certain of our battery manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Canada, are
carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same
goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture."
15,What role does GM’s OnStar service play in its connected vehicle strategy?,"OnStar provides safety, security, and connectivity services, including crash response, emergency assistance, and vehicle diagnostics, helping GM expand its subscription-based revenue.","GM Defense GM Defense is developing products and solutions for global government and military customers by leveraging GM's commercial
investments in vehicle, electrification, autonomy and connected vehicle technologies. GM Defense's growth strategy is focused on building a portfolio of
products, including the Infantry Squad Vehicle and the armored Heavy Duty SUV. Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include
overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which
we compete varies widely. We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share."
16,What is General Motors’ approach to corporate governance?,"GM’s governance focuses on transparency, ethics, and diversity. The company has a diverse board of directors and is committed to promoting equity and inclusion across its operations.","* * * * * * *

17,How does General Motors manage its relationship with dealerships?,GM works with a global network of independent dealerships to market and service its vehicles. These dealerships also provide after-sales services and vehicle financing options to customers.,"In addition to the products sold to dealers for
consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet
customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision
repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet
the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet and Wuling brands."
18,What are General Motors’ plans for new technology and product development?,"GM invests significantly in product development, focusing on EVs, AVs, and connected technologies. Its Global Product Development team collaborates on designing and integrating new vehicles and components.","Research and
development expenses were $9.8 billion, $7.9 billion and $6.2 billion in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Product Development The Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing and integrating all global products and their
components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our
Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, where our global teams in Design, Program Management & Execution, Component & Subsystem
Engineering, Product Safety, Systems & Integration, Software Defined Vehicle & Embedded Platforms, Electrification & Battery Systems, Technology
Acceleration & Commercialization and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale. 5Table of Contents
GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
We continue to invest in key ICE segments, which are critical to fund our all-electric future. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize
our vehicle portfolio profitability, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle sales volume expected to come from five internal
combustion vehicle architectures through this decade."
19,How does GM manage supply chain challenges?,"GM addresses supply chain risks through partnerships, long-term supplier agreements, and diversified sourcing. Recent disruptions have led GM to focus on building a more resilient, North America-focused EV supply chain.","As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent
upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some
instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for
supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a public health crisis, such as a global
pandemic, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial
difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our
18Table of Contents

suppliers’ operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including
the production of certain higher margin vehicles. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread or reemerges and results in a prolonged period of travel,
commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience continued and/or additional global supply disruptions. When we experience supply
disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly."
20,What is the purpose of GM’s Ultium Cells joint venture?,"GM partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce battery cells for its EVs, supporting its goal of scaling EV production. The joint venture’s plants in the U.S. will help GM achieve its battery production targets.","We plan to leverage the versatility and flexibility of Ultium to expand our EV portfolio over a wide
variety of segments and price points including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV,
which are expected to be launched over 2023 and 2024. In 2021, we began production at GM’s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated
EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV, the upcoming Cruise Origin, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the GMC Sierra EV. In January 2022, we
announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for fully dedicated EV production, including the Chevrolet Silverado EV
and the GMC Sierra EV. Additionally, we have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells Holdings
LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Warren, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based
battery cell plant is also planned."
21,What competitive advantages does GM have?,"GM’s competitive advantages include its strong brand portfolio, extensive global distribution network, and its Ultium platform, which enables flexibility and scalability in EV production.","The global automotive industry is highly
competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make,
significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as
described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to efficiently close
facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry
participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle
prices."
22,What challenges does GM face in the autonomous vehicle market?,"GM’s AV strategy faces technological, regulatory, and consumer acceptance challenges. Cruise’s success depends on advancing autonomous technology, securing regulatory approvals, and expanding commercial deployments.","Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM
International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity
ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or
marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and
commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM
Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7."
23,How does GM address employee diversity and inclusion?,"GM promotes diversity and inclusion through various programs, including employee resource groups and an Inclusion Advisory Board. The company also provides inclusive leadership training and emphasizes diverse hiring practices.","Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every moment, we must decide what
we can do — individually and collectively — to drive meaningful, deliberate and long-lasting change. GM’s unwavering commitment in this regard includes
taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are supportive of a world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the
needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a
culture that celebrates our differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is
currently made up of almost 50% women (6 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically diverse (4 out of 13 members)."
24,How does GM mitigate climate-related risks?,"GM mitigates climate risks by investing in EVs, reducing emissions, and adopting renewable energy. The company’s goal is to be carbon neutral by 2040, with plans to align with evolving climate regulations.","For a discussion of the net interest income sensitivity of GM Financial, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Furthermore, holding other factors constant, the higher interest rate environment may decrease
the affordability of our vehicles for customers who rely on financing to purchase a vehicle. We also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive
pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, potentially weakening economic conditions, labor disruptions, foreign exchange
volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A."
25,How does General Motors describe its company mission and purpose?,"General Motors aims to pioneer innovations that move and connect people to what matters. GM’s mission includes building safe, high-quality vehicles while promoting zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion as part of its long-term goals.","Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM
International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity
ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or
marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and
commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM
Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7."
26,What is General Motors' strategy for autonomous vehicle development?,"GM’s strategy involves advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology primarily through its subsidiary, Cruise. GM and Cruise are focused on creating fully autonomous, all-electric vehicles and have launched a driverless ride-hailing service in select U.S. cities, with plans to expand further.","GM Defense GM Defense is developing products and solutions for global government and military customers by leveraging GM's commercial
investments in vehicle, electrification, autonomy and connected vehicle technologies. GM Defense's growth strategy is focused on building a portfolio of
products, including the Infantry Squad Vehicle and the armored Heavy Duty SUV. Competitive Position and Vehicle Sales The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include
overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which
we compete varies widely. We present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share."
27,How does General Motors address consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs)?,"GM is scaling its EV production and investing in the development of a wide EV portfolio, including popular models like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Hummer EV. By 2025, GM aims to produce over two million EVs annually through its Ultium platform, targeting both consumer and commercial markets.","In addition, consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. Consumer adoption of EVs could be impacted by numerous factors,
including the breadth of the portfolio of EVs available; perceptions about EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost relative to ICE vehicles; the
range over which EVs may be driven on a given battery charge; the proliferation of charging infrastructure, in particular with respect to public EV charging
stations, and the success of the Company's charging infrastructure programs and strategic joint ventures and other relationships; cost and availability of high
fuel-economy ICE vehicles; volatility, or a sustained decrease, in the cost of petroleum-based fuel; failure by governments and other third parties to make
the investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, and to provide
economic incentives promoting the adoption of EVs, including those contemplated by the Inflation Reduction Act; and negative feedback from stakeholders
impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry. If we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy, it could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects, and could negatively impact our brand and reputation. Our near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks. While we offer a
broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a broad portfolio of EVs, we
currently recognize the highest profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE trucks."
28,What are General Motors' key segments and markets?,"GM operates in North America and internationally through two primary segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI). In the U.S., GM’s brands like Chevrolet and GMC hold significant market share, while China is a major market under its Baojun and Wuling brands through joint ventures.","70Table of Contents

GM Financial. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology. Nonsegment operations are classified
as Corporate."
32,What competitive advantages does General Motors highlight in its strategy?,"GM leverages its strong brand reputation, wide distribution network, and advanced technology like the Ultium platform to maintain a competitive edge. The company also emphasizes its leadership in autonomous technology through Cruise and its commitment to sustainability.","The global automotive industry is highly
competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make,
significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as

participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle
prices."
33,What major risks does General Motors face in the automotive industry?,"GM’s risks include economic fluctuations, supply chain challenges, and regulatory changes. Competition from new EV and AV players, evolving consumer preferences, and raw material cost volatility also impact GM’s strategic planning and profitability.","Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to any
significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities. GMI Industry sales in China were 23.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 9.2% compared to the

generated equity income of $0.7 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022."
34,How does GM approach sustainability within its operations?,"GM is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. It focuses on reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy use, and advancing EV production. GM also has waste reduction and water conservation initiatives across its global facilities.","The chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are
part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible
for executing our strategic initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract
customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting required fuel efficiency
standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis. Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through
distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned."
35,What recent product launches has GM undertaken in the EV segment?,"Recent launches include the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and BrightDrop Zevo electric delivery vans. GM is also planning to release the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Chevrolet Blazer EV, among other models, to expand its EV portfolio further.","Additionally, we are incubating several new businesses with a start-up mindset
that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas. Electric Vehicles We plan to rapidly scale our capacity to build one million EVs in North America and more than two million EVs globally by the end of
2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our dedicated electric vehicle propulsion architecture. This platform is flexible and will be leveraged
across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and
development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles. Our first Ultium-based products launched in 2021 with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop
Zevo 600, followed by the Cadillac LYRIQ in 2022."
36,How is GM addressing the global demand for sustainable raw materials?,"GM has secured strategic sourcing agreements for critical EV materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The company’s goal is to create a North American-focused supply chain for EV materials to ensure reliable access and reduce environmental impact.","This includes securing supply through
offtake agreements for EV raw materials, such as lithium, cathode active material, synthetic and natural graphite, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements and
permanent motor magnets. These EV-related agreements may require us to hold higher than normal levels of EV raw materials inventory. Expected demand
for these raw materials currently exceeds the capacity of the existing supply chain and our raw material sourcing strategy aims to secure raw material supply
to support our EV transition. Commodity costs are expected to remain elevated due to the macro-economic environment and the continuing existence of tariffs. In addition, global
supply chain disruptions have had, and are continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry."
37,What is GM's approach to workplace diversity and inclusion?,"GM promotes a culture of diversity and inclusion through employee resource groups, diversity training, and recruitment initiatives. The company’s Inclusion Advisory Board, chaired by CEO Mary Barra, guides efforts to enhance equity across its workforce.","Diversity, Equity and Inclusion At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every moment, we must decide what
we can do — individually and collectively — to drive meaningful, deliberate and long-lasting change. GM’s unwavering commitment in this regard includes
taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are supportive of a world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the
needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a
culture that celebrates our differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is
currently made up of almost 50% women (6 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically diverse (4 out of 13 members)."
38,What regulatory challenges does GM face in the EV market?,GM must comply with varying global regulations on emissions and fuel economy. California’s zero-emission vehicle mandates and China’s New Energy Vehicle credits program are examples. GM manages these by increasing EV production and aligning with regional standards.,"For a discussion of the net interest income sensitivity of GM Financial, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Furthermore, holding other factors constant, the higher interest rate environment may decrease
the affordability of our vehicles for customers who rely on financing to purchase a vehicle. We also face continuing market, operating and regulatory challenges in several countries across the globe due to, among other factors, competitive
pressures, our product portfolio offerings, heightened emission standards, potentially weakening economic conditions, labor disruptions, foreign exchange
volatility, evolving trade policy and political uncertainty. Refer to Part I, Item 1A."
39,How does General Motors support employee development?,"GM invests in employee growth through training programs, mentorship, and career development resources. Initiatives like the GM Technical Learning University and partnerships with universities offer employees opportunities to expand their skills.","Employees in some of our technical roles also have the
opportunity to participate in the GM Technical Learning University — a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical
prowess of our workforce. GM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. All new managers in the Company are automatically entered into a six-month
immersive learning program and all new executives come together for an upskilling and targeted development program designed around the GM leadership
profile. Safety and Well-Being The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely — Every Person, Every Site, Every Day."
40,How does GM ensure product safety across its vehicles?,"GM follows stringent safety protocols, including regular audits and recalls if needed. Its Speak Up for Safety program encourages employees to report safety issues proactively, and GM’s products undergo rigorous testing to meet global safety standards.","Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost
exclusively with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service
contracts, which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions. The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success, now, and as we transition to our all-electric future, given
that they maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers,
we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory
requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters. Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and
development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to
vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of drivers and passengers."
41,What is GM's long-term vision for autonomous vehicles?,"GM envisions a future with autonomous, all-electric vehicles integrated into urban transportation. Cruise’s AV technology is central to this vision, focusing on improving road safety and reducing congestion in cities through fully autonomous, self-driving cars.","Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM
International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity
ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or
marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and

significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as
described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to efficiently close
facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry
participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle
prices."
44,What are GM’s primary sources of revenue?,"GM’s main revenue sources include vehicle sales, software-enabled services, and financing through GM Financial. Revenue also comes from newer initiatives like BrightDrop’s commercial EV solutions and subscriptions for services like OnStar.","60Table of Contents

Government Incentives and Grants We receive incentives from federal, state and local governments in different regions of the world that primarily
encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, employment, or production in the region. We account for government incentives as a reduction
of expense, a reduction of the cost of the capital investment, or other income based on the substance of the incentive received. Benefits are generally
recorded when there is reasonable assurance of receipt and amounts are recorded in earnings as the expenses in which the incentive is meant to offset are
incurred, as we meet the conditions of the grant or as the capital investment is depreciated. At December 31, 2022, cash incentives receivable in Accounts
and notes receivable, net of allowance was $300 million, cash incentives receivable in Other assets was $248 million and deferred incentive income in Other
liabilities was $250 million. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $234 million in Automotive and other cost of sales associated with
