ITO THE STOCKHOLDERS:
EV ERY effort has been made in developing the annual reports from year to
year to present all salient facts of a general and economic character to enable
the stockholders to obtain as comprehensive an understanding as possible
of the year’s operations. On account of the unusual circumstances existing at the
moment, particular consideration has been given to that policy in the current report.
In addition to the usual treatment of the subject there has been added a review of
the effects of three years of the current industrial depression on the Corporation’s
operating position. It is hoped that this will prove interesting and instructive.
A FINANCIAL REVIEW
The consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated income of
General Motors Corporation and subsidiary companies for the year ended De-
cember 31, 1932, are submitted herewith. Attention is called to the fact that the
accounts of certain subsidiary and affiliated companies are not consolidated in the
accounts ofworporation. A list of such companies, not consolidated, is set forth
in detail,& page 26.
Earnings: Net earnings from operations for the year 1932, after full
depreciation charges as hereafter set forth, were $164,979. This compares with
earnings of $115,220,507 from operations for the year 1’931, before deduction, how-
ever, of extraordinary and non-recurring losses other than those of an operating
nature, of $20574,514, equivalent after taxes, to $18,343,400, resulting in earnings
of $96,877,107 available for dividends.
The net earnings from operations for the year 1932 of $164,979 are after
deducting a non-operating loss totalling $1,802,565, of which $711,585 is due to a
further revaluation of securities held by the General Exchange Insurance Corpora-
tion to current market and $1,090,980 due to further provision for foreign exchange
losses. These have not been segregated in the earnings statement of 1932 as was
done in the case of the year 1931.
Dividends: Regular dividends were declared on the preferred stock during the
year requiring $9,206,387. This resulted in a net charge to surplus of $9,041,408,
equivalent to $0.21 per share on the common stock outstanding. In 1931, after
deducting corresponding dividends on the preferred stock, there remained net
earnings for that year of $87,501,208, equivalent to $2.01 per share of common
stock outstanding. Dividends of $1.25 per share were paid on the common stock
during the year 1932 consisting of a payment of $0.50 per share in March and
quarterly payments of $0.25 per share in June, September and December. There
resulted a further charge to surplus of $53,993,330, making a total charge to surplus
on account of both preferred and common dividends in excess of earnings of
$63,034,738.
cANNUAL REPORT OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Surplus as of December 31, 1932 was $238,231,744. This compares with the
corresponding item at the close of the previous year of $301,266,482.
A complete record of the earnings of the Corporation, as well as dividend
disbursements for the year under review and prior years, is shown on page 29 of
this report.
Net Working Cepital: For ready reference the following table shows briefly
all consolidated working capital items as of December 31, 1932, as compared
with corresponding items as of December 31, 1931:-

Net Working Capital. . . . . . . . . . $225,437,194 $273,915,923
It will be noted that net working capital at the end of 1932 was $225,437,194
as compared with $273,915,923 at the end of 1931-a decrease of $48,478,729.
This decrease in net working capital as of December 31, 1932 is accounted for
principally by a reduction of $63,034,738 as a result of the excess of dividend
disbursements over earnings during the year and, secondarily, by an excess of
$19,323,776 in withdrawals from Employes Savings Fund accounts over receipts
as explained in greater detail below. These unfavorable factors affecting net working
capital were to some extent offset by a decrease in net plant account, described
below, which had a favorable effect of $34,354,371 on the Corporation’s net
working capital position.
Reference to the Corporation’s consolidated balance sheet will disclose the
fact that under its regular accounting procedure the amount of Employes Savings
.6.FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1939
Funds payable within one year is reflected under Current Liabilities. This item
is estimated as of December 31, 1932 to be $15,193,660. This compares with
$14,875,637 at the corresponding period of a year ago. The operations of the Em-
ployes Savings and Investment Plan were suspended as of April 30, 1932, after
which no further amounts were received by the Corporation from its employes. The
subnormal operations of the Corporation during the year under review, due to the
generally unfavorable economic conditions prevailing, resulted in materially re-
duced employes’ earnings as well as elimination of personnel. Therefore, there
followed unusual withdrawals from the Savings Funds during the year, likewise
necessitating provision for probable increased withdrawals during the year 1933.
This fact, together with the suspension of the plan, accounts for the unfavorable
effect of the operations of the plan upon net working capital during the year in the
amount previously stated. Payments against Employes Savings Funds payable
subsequent to one year are shown in the form of a reserve which, on the balance
sheet of December 31, 1932, was $11,907,362. The corresponding item at the close
of the year 1931 was $31,231,138. The extent to which net working capital can be
further adversely affected on account of subsequent withdrawals is now limited to
$11,907,362.
Cash, United States Government and other marketable securities as of De-
cember 31, 1932 amounted to $172,780,695. This compares with $205,029,119 at
the close of the previous year and with $179,037,071 as of December 31, 1930.
Real Estate, Plant and Equipment Account: Before certain special adjustments
between real estate, plant and equipment account and reserves for depreciation
applicable thereto and hereafter described in detail, the total real estate,
plant and equipment account was $592,694,766, which is $11,406,044 less than the
corresponding item a year ago. Depreciation reserves show a net increase as a result
of the year’s operations of $22,948,327. Therefore, there results a net decrease in
real estate, plant and equipment account, after deducting these reserves, of
$34,354,371. Sales, removals or abandonment of property during the year amounted
to $16,395,345.
Attention is called to the fact that total charges for depreciation against
earnings in the year were $37,173,647. This is a decrease of $792,084 from corres-
ponding charges of $37,965,731 for 1931-the latter constituting the largest annual
charge against earnings on account of depreciation in the history of the Corporation.
The lowered depreciation charge amounting to a reduction of 2.1% as compared
with the previous year is accounted for by the lower average gross plant account
in 1932 due to the sale or abandonment of certain plant assets.
It is the practice of the Corporation to carry real estate, plant and equipment
items at cost and to set up adequate amounts for depreciation. In addition to such
depreciation charges there is absorbed against current operating revenue, liberal
charges for maintenance, while dies, tools and fixtures applicable to specific models
are written off during the life of the model usually within one year.
The question very naturally arises, in view of the adjustments in values that
have taken place as a result of the economic depression, as to whether or not the
reserves established by the Corporation from year to year are adequate to reflect
properly any reduction in value of thereal estate, plant and equipment account that
.7*
tANNUAL REPORT OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION -
may develop under existing circumstances. Unquestionably, these circumstances in
extent are of temporary character, but the degree to which that is true is impossible
to state with certainty at this time. Consolidations and eliminations of a portion
of the Corporation’s plant are a natural and necessary sequence to a situation
through which all industry is at the moment passing, so that there results property -
that temporarily at least is unusable. In order that facts might be available with
respect to these questions, a study has been made during the year under review,
with the following result :-
It can be stated that the reserves set up for depreciation
are sufficient to write down to salvage value all real
.
estate, plant and equipment which has become com-
9
pletely idle and further, to readjust the values of all
plant which remains in operation to its 1932 repro- .
ductive value less depreciaton.
Having established the above facts, the following action has been taken with
respect to same :-
Surplus real estate, plant and equipment in the amount .
of $115,491,946, previously carried at cost, has been
adjusted to estimated salvage value of $22,779,411,
the difference of $92,712,535 being charged against re-
serves for depreciation, which have already been pro-
vided, so that the net book value of the plant account
amounting to $328,273,745 remains unchanged.
The effect of the above will be (a) a readjustment in the real estate, plant and
equipment account in the form of a reduction of $92,712,535-from $592,694,766 to
$499,982,231, with a corresponding reduction in the reserve for depreciation from
$264,421,021 to $17 1,708,486 which will reflect more correctly present conditions;
(b) since such items have been reduced to their salvage value they will no longer
be depreciated, so that in the future the annual provision for depreciation
applicable to real estate, plant and equipment will be reduced by approximately
$7,000,000. It should be noted that this adjustment will involve no change in the
Corporation’s depreciation policy with respect to annual depreciation rates as
applied to the several classes of property.
At such time and to such extent as economic conditions improve, requiring
the operation of plant, unusable under present conditions, the policy will be to
reinstate in the accounts the then values of such properties, and to amortize such
values over their remaining useful life by charges against operations for depreciation
-thus to maintain the accuracy of the Corporation’s cost accounting. There is
certainly no economic justification in reducing the value of current usable assets
below their sound reproductive value-such as placing a nominal value on same,
eliminating in that way, in whole or in part, depreciation not only actually but
essentially a part of the cost of production, hence uneconomically inflating future
stated profits. The cost of sales should reflect at all times a depreciation charge
based upon the useful life of such real estate, plant and equipment and other
items essential to production. The selling price should reflect in principle,
among other factors, a reasonable return on capital invested in all essential pro-
ductive capacity. In no other way can a sound economic foundation be established.FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1932
and
Investments in Subsidiary Affiliated Companies not Consolidated: During
the year there were no material changes in the Corporation’s investments in sub-
sidiary and affiliated companies. It will be recalled that as of December 31, 1931,
and as pointed out in the annual report covering that year, investments in certain
subsidiary and affiliated companies, not consolidated, were adjusted to reflect
General Motors proportion of the undivided profits or losses of those subsidiaries
for the year 1931. The increase or decrease in investments in the Corporation’s
various subsidiary and affiliated companies applicable to the year 1932 is due (a)
to the reflection of the Corporation’s proportion of the undivided profits or losses
of the subsidiary or affiliated companies for the year; (b) to investments that may
have been made in same or disposed of within the year.
Investments in subsidiary and affiliated companies, not consolidated, are shown
at the close of the year as $211,030,901, against $211,548,200 for the previous year-
a reduction of $517,299. As in the case of real estate, plant and equipment, already
dealt with, the question arises as to the present worth of such items under the
unusual circumstances existing at the moment. Since these investments are, in
general, of permanent character to be retained in the normal course of business,
and since the major portion of same represents wholly owned subsidiaries, there
are difficulties in establishing a basis upon which an acceptable appraisal may be
made. Recognizing these difficulties, however, a survey has been made which
indicates that while under existing subnormal conditions certain items may be
over-valued, others are unquestionably under-valued. The conclusion of this survey
which appraised these items on various bases was that the value as a whole as
reported in the balance sheet is substantially correct at this time.
Capital Account: There were no changes during the year.
AN OPERATING REVIEW
It was stated under this heading in the annual report covering the year 1931,
that the automotive industry, constituting the most important part of the Car-
poration’s sphere of activity, as well as industry in general, suffered a declining
trend and that the close of that year showed no substantial evidence of any in+
provement in that trend. This statement of fact applicable to 1931 is all the more
true with respect to the year 1932, during, the first half of which the rapidity of
I-.. m.._*,, _.. I. ..

commenced. In view of the fact that an important part of the Corporation’s
proas is sold during the first six months, there resulted a very sharp de-
cline in the Corporation’s sales for the year. Somewhat ,of an improvement took
pl+Lwhe months of August, September and October but, unfortun-

It naturally follows that a shrinkage in volume of such a substantial amount
on top of important reductions applying to both the years 1930 and 1931 presented
a problem of”the first magnitude to the operating organization on account of the

of not only the executive staff but every member of the organization, however or
wherever placed. It is gratifying to be able to state that all these necessary read-
justments have been accepted with a full appreciation of their necessity and with
the maintenance of loyalty to the Corporation which has been such an important
influence in developing it to the position it now holds.
In accordance with its yearly custom, the Corporation recently presented to
the public its offerings in the form of an entirely new line of automotive products
for the year 1933. At the time of writing this report it is too early to definitely
evaluate, in a statistical way, the acceptance of these products, but from such
information as is now available, it can be said that never before in the history of
the Corporation has there been such an outstanding and enthusiastic acceptance
of its products, both from the standpoint of their technical excellence and progress
as well as from the standpoint of their artistic conception.
Such ass important- reduction in volume as _i”s L n“ .oaw”X ,b,^e-iI“n^.ag,-” .”,e , xperienced-injects
into the situation important limitations of action. Notwithstanding such limitations
B the policy will be to in no way circu.rnscribe?echm~a. ,Erogress which mustnot
only be maintamed-but -ace&rated, if possible. This is because around technical
progress the Cbrporatidil”‘S-‘~~o~rcts-.rnu~t ‘be developed and upon the excellence
of those products it must depend for its share in a highly competitive market.
Furthermore, upon that same foundation is built the ability of the industry of
which the Corporation is an important part, to obtain its share of the field of
transportation. The objective, therefore, must be the continual development of
more attractive, more efficient and more economical products, resulting in not
only increased value for the dollar but what is of even greater importance, values
for a smaller number of dollars in harmony with the reduced resources of the
various markets which are being served.
Operating Facts and Figures: Net sales, excluding inter-company and inter-divis-
ional transactions, amounted to $432,311,868 as compared with $808,840,723 during
the year 1931-a redu_c_t-i,o- n..- “o- L46&.motal sales to dealers, including Canadian and
overseas sales, amounted to 562,970 units as against 1,074,709 for the year 1931--a
reduction of 47.6ye. Stocks cars and trucks in the hands of dealers in the
United States were reduced 37,201 units during the year 1932 with a corresponding
adverse influence on 1932 sales to dealers. Based upon automotive registrations in
the United States, the Corporation secured 41.5% of all passenger car registrations
and 40.4% of the total passenger and commercial car registrations. This compares
with 43.3% and 41.6% in 1931 and with 34.5% and 33.7(% in the year 1930.
Reference has already been made to the introduction of the 1933 line of
General Motors automotive products which were developed during the year 1932
and in which are incorporated many important changes, both of a technical and
artistic character. In general these offerings represent increased values at a de-
* 10 aFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEtiBER 31, 1939
creased number of dollars. Moreover, there has been added an additional series
through the Chevrolet Motor Division at a smaller number of dollars than ever
before equalled in the history of the Corporation.
The Corporation’s 1933 line of passenger cars from the Chevrolet up to and
including the Cadillac V-12 are offered in eighty-nine body types, with list prices
ranging from $445 to $4,845. The Cadillac V-16 will hereafter be entirely custom
built-there being sixty-one possible model suggestions with prices ranging from
$6,250 to $10,600. The full line of the Corporation’s products with the price range
of each, is listed below.

THE INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION
Its Economic and Operating Influences
The year 1932 may be considered as the t@d year of the current industrial
depression. On account of the depression’s severity, itsdztEmFEm=s
that are likely to permanently result therefrom, the question naturally arises in

In the innumerable questions of policy which have arisen Itiith respect% all phases

chawd circumstances, lrresp&lve of past thniXiEg;‘for’ even outside of the direct
interest of the stockholders and the management’s responsibility to same, it is of
vital moment that industry be kept in as effective an operating position as possible.
An employer sound from both the financial and operating standpoints is essential
to the interests of the employe as well as of the community at large.
Before dealing with the specific questions involved, a measure of the effect
of the depression on the trend of sales in units and dollar value of the automotive
industry as a whole will be helpful in presenting a better appreciation of the prob-
lem. The following table displays the production of the automotive industry in the
United States and Canada, as well as of assembly plants operated abroad, both in
terms of units and in terms of estimated retail sales value thereof in dollars for
twelve years up to and including 1932.

year the depression set in and the largest year that the automotive industry
has as yet en joyed-showed a decf~~~~-~~~~~~~~.~~~ in
terms of--s. Again, in examining still further into the history of the auto-
motive industry we must go back to the year 1918 or 14 years to find a rate of
production less than 1932. In that connection it is important to note that at that
time there were 6,147,OOO cars in current use in the United States as compared
with approximately 24,100,OOOc ars as of 1932.
The above statement together with the additional fact that the total registra-
tion of motor cars has been but slightly reduced during the depression period and
that gasoline consumption has been well maintained-reaching an all time peak
in 1931 and recording a reduction of only 7.5oj, for the year 1932-demonstrates
that there is being rapidly &@et.eQn important amount of motor car mile inven-

Notwithstanding the natural reflection of the circumstances of the period
under review on the Corporation’s profit position, earnings available for dividends
amounted to $248,141,078. In no one of the three years in question has a loss been
recorded. There was disbursed in dividends a total of $343,114,279-$28,120,946
applicable to preferred stock and $314,993,333 to common stock. This means that
there was distributed an excess of dividends over earnings available for dividends of
$94,973,201. The policy with respect to the disbursement of dividends in periods
of subnormal activity and reduced earnings incident to same, has been stated to be
that the Corporation owes a responsibility to its stockholders and through its
stockholders to the community at large to maintain maximum possible purchasing
power, hence to continue dividends at such a rate as circumstances may seem to
justify, but only to the point where the financial strength of the Corporation is not
jeopardized. The maintenance of that positionmust always be the first consideration.
Net working capital, notwithstanding the above disbursements, has been
reduced $25,850,588 during the period. Cash and cash investments have been
increased $45,429,165-from $127,351,530 as of December 31, 1929 to $172,780,695
as of December 31, 1932. Further, there has been absorbed in cost and charged to
depreciation during the period a total of $112,854,466 resulting, after giving weight
to property sold, removed and abandoned in excess of property acquired, in a total
increase during the period in reserves for depreciation of $70,326,058 before the
special adjustment already described.

other%_o..-,, rd- s.I ,“ *.,..l tZie’%bje&ves set forth at the beginning of this statement have been
substantially achieved.
Reduction in variable or controllable expense has been a continuous problem
during the period and has been kept well in line with reduction in volume. During
the first two years this took the form of curtailment and elimination of certain
activities as well as reduction in personnel. During the last year it became necessary
to deal with the problem more fundamentally through reorganization and con-
solidation. As a result of the policies just outlined the break-even point has been
continually reduced and in 1933, based upon the Corporation’s budgetary estimates
for that year, further progress will be effected.
During the period research and engineering activities have been aggressively
continued, for upon advanced products the Corporation must depend to maintain
its position in a highly competitive industry. The 1933 products already referred
to in this report are a direct reflection of that policy. The competitive position of
the Corporation is a measure of the technical excellence of its products as well as
the effectiveness of its distributing organization. During the period there has been
an improvement in this regard as indicated by the increased proportion of newFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1939
passenger car registrations represented by the Corporation’s products. In 1929
there was secured 32.8% of the total passenger car business; in 1930, 34.50Jo; in
1931, 43.3yo; in 1932, 41.5%.
Entirely apart from the influence of the depression period on the operations
and policy of the Corporation itself and yet intimately associated with same, is its
influence on the operating personnel, upon the efficiency and ability of which
depends the degree of success which the Corporation will achieve, as well as its
ability to carry through the present difficult period.
It has always been considered-and that policy still holds-that the interest
of the stockholders is most effectively served through an operating personnel of
the highest order of ability and aggressiveness possible to obtain and through
liberally rewarding such talent in proportion to the productivity of its efforts as
measured by the returns produced for the stockholders. In good times such rewards
are, very properly, generous, as they are to the stockholders. In times of subnormal
activity and reduced earnings, frequently accompanied, as in the present cirCum-
stances, with a substantial reduction in the cost of living, it is eminently proper
that the compensation of the personnel should be likewise adjusted.
In line with this thinking there has been a reduction in salaries on a sliding
scale of from 20% to 300j0, as well as a reduction in the base wage scale. All sup-
plementary..p&?t sharing pIans as applied to the executive group become,’ under
such circumstances, automatically non-operative, and the Employes Savings and
Investment Plan has been suspended. Reductions in both salaries and wages were
effected with great regret as a vital part of the necessary adjustments and with the
recognition of the fact that in so doing the spread between the necessities of life
and income was narrowed, resulting in a decline in ability to purchase many things
important to the American standard of living. Full appreciation of the importance
of this fact will, it is hoped, lead to a readjustment at the earliest moment that
circumstances make possible.
A brief statement as to effects of the Employes Savings and Investment Plan,
which has been a part of the Corporation’s cooperative programs for many years
past, should be of interest because it is confidently believed that an important
contribution both in method and in fact has been made in answering industry’s
social obligations to its workers in times of stress. The personnel of the Corporation
entered 1930, at the beginning of the industrial depression, as a result of the pre-
vious five years’ contribution to the Employes Savings and Investment Plan, with
a reserve of approximately $75,000,000, representing in reality a cash reserve of
that amount. In addition to this, there was an equity of approximately $15,000,000
which had been diverted to the purchase of homes under the provision of the plan
or, in other words, savings of approximately $90,000,000 were available. During
the three year period, 1930 to 1932 inclusive, there has been withdrawn a total of
$78,000,000. There were further payments made into the fund by employes and the
Corporation from January 1, 1930 up to April 30, 1932, at which time the plan was
suspended, which, together with interest and dividends, amounted to $48,000,000
and at the end of 1932 there was still available $47 ,OOO,OOtOo meet the contingencies
of the future, to which should be added $13,000,~ remaining equity in the pur-
chase of homes or a total of $60,000,000.ANNUAL REPORT OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
This survey of the influences of the industrial depression would not be complete
without reference to the effects of same on the economic position of the twenty
thousand dealers which constitute the Corporation’s distributing system and who
represent the Corporation, so far as its contacts with the public are concerned, in
practically every community of consequence throughout the United States.
Naturally, such an important shrinkage in volume as has been experienced,
with the consequent reduction in gross income incident to same, presents a problem
to each and every dealer similar in general characteristics to those that have
arisen within the Corporation itself. The years 1920 to 1930 inclusive, constituted
a period of expansion of practically all of the Corporation’s activities. During that
time its competitive position was increased from approximately 16% in 1920 to
33.7% in 1930 with a still further increase to 40.4% in 1932 and its sales in number
of units from 393,000 in 1920 to a maximum approaching 1,900,OOO in 1929.
This meant a policy of intense concentration, otherwise such a result would have
been impossible. As a part of that policy of concentration the activities of the
dealer group were, to an important degree, limited to the sale of one of the Cor-
poration’s line of products. During the first two years of the period in question,
it was recognized by both the dealer organization and the Corporation that over-
head or the cost of doing business must of necessity be reduced in proportion to
the reduced volume. Very constructive results were obtained in this general direc-
tion. Early in the year 1932, however, the third year under review, it was recognized
that with the continuance of the depression and its probable increasing intensity
more drastic action was essential. Therefore, during that year a general r._eIo_r ganiza-
tion of the relationships between the Corporation’s products and its dealers was
initiated consisting ofthe consolidation, “within many- dealerships of more than one
line of products- the objective being the establishment and maintenance of a
more economic relationship between income and expense--both of the latter
being measured with respect to current circumstances.
The problem presented was one of extreme difficulty but, as in the case of the
Corporation itself, it was recognized that the only way to adequately meet such a
situation was to face the facts and to aggressively and as intelligently as possible-
respecting to the fullest extent the equities of the various interests involved-do
those things that would preserve in as effective a manner as possible, the large
investments involved as well as their earning power. It is gratifying to be able to
state that this adjustment has, to a material extent, been effected. The Manage-
ment has at all times recognized the importance of dealer stability and has striven
earnestly to do those things that will build up and strengthen the economic position
and effectiveness of this most important instrumentality upon which it must
completely depend for the distribution of its products to the individual purchaser.

operating properties.FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1932
General Motors Overseas
In view of the important position that the Corporation has developed in its
overseas operations, a statement with respect to that phase of its activities may
be of interest. On page 33 is presented a summary of overseas sales, from which it
will be noted that there was a reduction in net wholesale value of such sales from
$110,525,817 in 1931 to $64,722,593 in 1932 and in terms of number of cars and
trucks sold from 125,606 in 1931 to 77,159 in 1932. In order that some appreciation
may be had of the important shrinkage in ‘overseas business that has taken place,
it may be stated, for ready reference, that the maximum yet reached in overseas
business was in the year 1928, at which time the net wholesale value amounted
to $252,152,284 and in number of cars and trucks sold to 282,157. The trend of
overseas business at the moment indicates that it is likely to become stabilized
at substantially current volume until the next upward movement takes place. It is
hardly to be expected, however, that any material increase can be hoped for until
in some way or other constructive action is taken to remove or reduce the many
restrictions on international commerce now existing, such as depreciated currencies,
restrictions on exchange, tariff barriers and embargoes.
Stockholders have been advised from time to time as to the development of
the Corporation’s position with respect to manufacturing activities overseas, par-
ticularly in Germany and England. In the year under review the operations con-
ducted in Germany through Adam Opel A. G. at Russelsheim, have been further
restricted due to the economic conditions prevailing in that country. Notwith-
standing this fact, Adam Opel A. G. has well maintained its competitive position
in its particular market.
In England the Corporation’s operations are on a somewhat smaller scale
than in Germany. It was deemed advisable, however, to expand in a moderate way
the Corporation’s activities in England which are conducted as Vauxhall Motors
Ltd., Luton, England. The enlarged program was well along toward completion at
the close of the year and the indications were that it would prove beneficial not only
toward strengthening the Corporation’s position in England but also within the
entire British Empire.
General Motors Acceptance Corporation
It has been the custom to refer in all annual reports to this activity, the opera-
tions of which have always been important and, under existing adverse circum-
stances, particularly so. The year’s operations while adversely affected by reduction
in volurne, nevertheless resulted in a substantial net profit. Credit losses have
increased, as well as repossessions of cars, as compared with the more prosperous
years of the past. Nevertheless the credit and repossession losses are relatively
small, which fact justifies the conclusion that even under the adverse circumstances
a sound foundation of consumer credit remains.
COOPERATIVE PLANS
Previous annual reports have dealt at length with various plans and programs
that have been established from time to time for the purpose of promoting the
effectiveness and well-being of the Corporation’s operating personnel. It has been
stated that the fundamental objective in all these plans has been to help the indi-
.I7 lANNUAL REPORT OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
vidual to help himself; to make him a better citizen; to give him the opportunity
to become independent. Reference has been made in other parts of this report to
the financial operation of certain of these plans to which might be added the
general statement that continued experience has served to strengthen the convic-
tion that such plans are sound and to the interest of the stockholders as well as
of the workers.
General Motors Management Corporation
This Corporation was formed in 1930, as covered in the annual report of that
year, for the purpose of interesting the Corporation’s executive staff in the owner-
ship of the Corporation’s securities, the underlying principle being that the efficiency
and effectiveness of management is enhanced and stimulated through direct
participation in the results of its own endeavors.
Due to the low level of earnings of General Motors Corporation in 1932 no
earnings will accrue in 1933 to the Management Corporation under its contract with
General Motors Corporation, dated March 12, 1930. It was stated in the annual
report of 1931 that the Management Corporation was able to retire only $3,125,000
of the $7,000,000 in bonds due March 15, 1932-the balance of $3,875,000 being
extended for a period of two years from that date. Since the Management Corpor-
ation will not receive any earnings under its contract above stated with respect
to the year 1932, a further deficiency with respect to bond retirement in the amount
of $7,000,000 at March 15, 1933, will result. The contract existing between General
Motors Corporation and the Management Corporation, already referred to, dated
March 12, 1930 provides, among other things, that under certain conditions the
retirement of bonds may be deferred. These conditions exist at present. Therefore,
the bonds due on March 15, 1933 to the amount of $7,000,000, referred to above,
will be extended to a time when the Management Corporation will have funds
available for their retirement.
In addition to the situation existing with respect to the retirement of the
Management Corporation bonds, all as explained above, the reduction in the rate
of the General Motors dividend made it possible to meet the interest payment,
maturing on September 15, 1932, only in part. After applying all of the dividends
received, payment of the balance amounting to $508,750 was deferred until divi-
dends are received sufficient to cover current requirements and make up the
deficiency. General Motors Corporation’s income through interest from the Man-
agement Corporation reflects only $1,610,000, the amount applicable to the interest
accrual for the year 1932 which the Management Corporation was able to pay out
of dividends received on General Motors common stock.
Bonus Plan
The Bonus Plan, as has been pointed out in previous reports, provides a
reward for conspicuous service to those individuals who have contributed out-
standingly to the progress of the Corporation during each year. Before any dis-
tribution takes place, however, there must be earned 7% on the capital employed
by the Corporation. In view of the fact that 7% was not earned during the year
under review, no bonus will be available for distribution. In order to make any
bonus available for distribution earnings must amount to approximately $1.10 per
share of common stock.
i-FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1939
Employes Savings and Investment Plan
This plan was inaugurated in 1919 and its detailed operations have been
dealt with in all annual reports since that date. At the close of 1932 the ninth class
of the Savings and Investment Fund, which was that of 1927, matured and as a
result there was paid to 29,972 employes, the following:-

This makes a total of. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $9,509,689
An employe who paid in $300 in the year 1927 will receive cash and securities
having a total value equivalent to $621.52 or 2.07 times the original investment
of $300. It has been pointed out elsewhere in this report that the Savings and In-
vestment Plan was suspended as of April 30, 1932.
Group Insurance Plan
During 1932 the Corporation lost 1,048 of its employes through death or
permanent disability on account of which payments totalling $2,273,306 were
approved for the benefit of such employes or their dependents and, in addition,
there were 9,834 employes who received benefits amounting to $827,739 on account
of temporary disability resulting from sickness or non-industrial accidents. Under
the Group Insurance Plan approved claims for the benefit of the Corporation’s
employes and their families, have totalled $16,491,080 from the inception of the
plan on December 1, 1926 up to and including December 31, 1932. The Group
Insurance Plan is available to all employes of the Corporation after three months’
service. At the end of 1932 over 99% of eligible employes were participating.
Education and Training
Activity was continued during the year in accordance with this plan as dealt
with in previous annual reports although on a reduced scale commensurate with
the general reduction in all the Corporation’s activities.
r
t
Housing for Employes
The point has been made in previous reports that the policy of the Corporation
with respect to this type of activity is not in any sense one of expansion but rather
of liquidation of its investment in the course of time by the sale of present property
holdings.
The subnormal employment characteristic of the year’s operations resulting
in reduced working hours and elimination of personnel presented a problem of
:.I9 =ANNUAL REPORT OF GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
considerable magnitude to the Corporation’s subsidiaries dealing with housing.
There developed an increasing number of cancellations of house contracts and
inability to maintain payments on others. In an endeavor to keep as many houses
as possible in the hands of buyers during the period of the depression-certainly
to the interest of the Corporation as well as that of its operating personnel-and
at the same time to collect such interest and principal on outstanding contracts
as under the existing circumstances was equitable, changes were made in housing
contracts as of April 1, 1932, modifying the interest rate and establishing a rela-
tionship between monthly payments and earnings.
GOODWILL AND PATENTS
This account as reported in the balance sheet amounted, as of December 31,
1932 to $51,839,436, showing a decrease, of $99,721 from December 31, 1931.
The Corporation’s standard accounting practice interprets goodwill as the differ-
ence between the purchase price and book value of properties acquired, and patents
as representing the cost of acquisition to the Corporation less subsequent amortiza-
tion.
It will be noted from the above interpretation that this account represents
only to a very minor degree the real intangible value of a group of highly specialized
manufacturing organizations with its executive personnel normally employing more
than 175,000 individuals, supported by a vast distributing organization of dealers,
the quality and excellence of whose products are well established not only in every
community of the United States but throughout the entire world.
PUBLIC RELATIONS
It is recognized that the Corporation’s most vital relationship is with the
public. Its suzcess depends on a correct interpretation of the public’s needs and
viewpo_in_. .t s as tie11 as on the. public’s< un@rstanding uf the motives tha ^t _“.a .-c lt .u l*a Il,lt .e .
the Corporation in everything it does.
In order ‘to formulate its “policies in harmony with this basic principle, no
effort is being spared to analyze and evaluate the public, forming the Corporation’s
actual and potential customers, in its thinking with respect to all things in which
the Corporation plays a part.
This represents, however, but one phase of the Corporation’s public relations
policy, for, while it is essential that the Corporation understand the public, it is
equally essential that the public understand the Corporation. Goodwill is established
and maintained not alone by excellence of product and service, but by a combina-
tion of this with public knowledge and acceptance of the policies of the Corporation.
The correct interpretation of such policies to the public is regarded as a primary
unction of management. Progressiv-.e-. 1.i.n..d-.u.A.s1_.t...r. .-y_I. ,I. ~ t, o.,d_a, _y, places the formulation of

l 90 lFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1939
STOCKHOLDERS
In line with the general trend since the Corporation was founded, the year
records another important increase in the total number of stockholders which,
at the close of the year, totalled 365,985-a gain of 52,868.
It is gratifying to any management and it is beneficial to any institution like
General Motors, to have as wide a distribution as possible of its ownership, indi-
cating as it does, confidence of the public at large in the future of the institution
and the honesty of purpose and effectiveness of its management. The number of
stockholders of all classes at the close of each year since 1917 is displayed on page 36.
CONCLUSION
It was stated in the annual report of 1931 that the difficulties and problems
of that year were unusual. To a very important extent that statement applies even
more forcibly to the year under review. The financial returns necessarily are dis-
appointing to the stockholders. This is even more true with respect to those who
have been carrying the operating burden, who have labored as never before to
deal with those problems and difficulties in aggravated form-characteristic of
the present circumstances. Performance under existing conditions cannot be
measured quantitatively in comparison with years in which the circumstances
were so entirely different, but must be considered with respect to the prevailing
conditions. Appraising the year’s results from that standpoint it can be stated
that the accomplishments have been important in meeting the continual decline
in volume; in the maintenance of the financial strength of the Corporation; in
the continuance of a cornmon dividend disbursement, even if at a reduced rate;
and in the marked advance in the effectiveness of the Corporation’s products which
were developed and brought into production during the period under review.
It is particularly fitting under the circumstances, as outlined, to record the
appreciation of the unusual efforts put forth and the sacrifice to the cause made on
the part of the entire personnel, both at home and abroad, during the year, of its

The General Motors Company of New Jersey, organized September 16, 1908, paid
regular dividends of 7 ‘% per annum upon its 7 “/0 cumulative preferred stock, without inter-
ruption, beginning with an initial payment on April 1, 1909. Since the organi_zatigg,g+n
October 13, 1916 of the present General Motors Corporation of Delaware, which succeeded
the General Motors Company of New Jersey, regular quarterly dividends have been paid,
without interruption, on the preferred and debenture stocks outstanding from their date

stock was paid February 1, 1919. The initial quarterly dividend of $1.75 a share on the
7% debenture stock was paid May 1, 1920. At a special meeting of stockholders on June 16,
1924, the name of the 7% debenture stock was changed to 7% preferred stock. The initial
dividend on the 7% preferred stock was paid November 1, 1924. At a special meeting of
stockholders on May 26, 1930, a new class of $5 preferred stock was offered in exchange for
the then outstanding senior securities. This exchange was made on the basis of 1.35 shares
of the new $5 preferred stock for each share of 7 $& preferred stock; 1.15 shares of new $5
preferred stock for each share of 6oj, debenture stock; and 1.10 shares of new $5 preferred
stock for each share of 6% preferred stock. Shares of 7% preferred, 6oj, debenture and
6% preferred stocks not so exchanged prior to July 22, 1930 were called for redemption on

also par value $100. On and after March 1, 1920, ten shares no par value common stock
were issued in exchange for one share of the old $100 par value common. On May 1, 1920,
there was paid on the $100 par value common a stock dividend of ti share of the new no
par common. During 1920, on May 1, August 2, and November 1, there were paid stock
dividends on the no par common, each amounting to l/40 share of no par common. On
account of charter changes, the number of shares of common stock was reduced in 1924
through the exchange of four shares of old stock for one share of new no par value common.
On September 11,1926, a 50% dividend was paid in common stock. During September 1927,
two shares of new $25 par value common stock were issued in exchange for one share of

ings after deducting 7% on the capital invested in the business. Prior to 1923 the sum so
credited to the bonus fund was 10% of the net earnings of the Corporation. Since 1923, at
which time the Managers Securities Company was organized, the amount set aside for the
bonus plan has been 57,.T he fund is invested in General Motors common stock or its

bonus stock has been awarded in Class A stock of General Motors Management Corpora-
