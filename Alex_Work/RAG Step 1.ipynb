BUSINESS    \\nPortillo’s Inc. (the “Company\") was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 8, 2021, in connection with our initial public offering in\\nOctober 2021 (\"IPO\") and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the \"Transactions”) in order to carry on the business of PHD\\nGroup Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (“Portillo’s OpCo”). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October 20, 2021, the\\nCompany became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo and now operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Portillo\\'s\\nOpCo. As a result, the Company consolidates the financial results of Portillo\\'s OpCo and reports a non-controlling interest representing\\nthe economic interest in Portillo\\'s OpCo held by the other members of Portillo\\'s OpCo (the \"pre-IPO LLC Members\"). Unless the context\\notherwise requires, references to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"Portillo\\'s,\" the \"Company\" and other similar references refer to Portillo\\'s Inc. and its\\nsubsidiaries, including Portillo’s OpCo.\\nOverview of Portillo\\'s\\nPortillo’s serves iconic Chicago street food in high-energy, multichannel restaurants designed to ignite the senses and create memorable\\ndining experiences. Since our founding in 1963 in a small trailer that Dick Portillo called “The Dog House,” we have grown to become a\\ntreasured brand with a passionate (some might say obsessed) nationwide following. Our diverse menu features all-American favorites\\nsuch as Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers, chopped salads, crinkle-cut fries, homemade\\nchocolate cake and signature chocolate cake shake. We create a consumer experience like no other by combining the best attributes of\\nfast-casual and quick-service concepts with an exciting energy-filled atmosphere in a restaurant model capable of generating tremendous\\nvolumes. Nearly all of our restaurants were built with double lane drive-thrus and have been thoughtfully designed with a layout that\\naccommodates a variety of access modes including dine-in, carryout, delivery and catering to quickly and efficiently serve our guests. No\\nmatter how our guests order from us, our highly productive kitchens and team members consistently serve high-quality food and deliver a\\nmemorable guest experience. We believe the combination of our craveable food, multichannel sales model, dedication to operational\\nexcellence, and distinctive team member-driven culture gives us a competitive advantage. Our business, including many of the elements\\ndescribed below, is subject to certain risks that may materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our desired outcomes. For a\\nmore in-depth discussion of such risks, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned and operated 84 restaurants across 10 states, including a restaurant owned by C&O Chicago,\\nL.L.C. (\"C&O\") of which we own 50% of the equity .\\nOur Story\\nWe relish the opportunity to create lifelong memories by igniting the senses with unrivaled food and experiences.\\nAn Iconic and Beloved Brand with Obsessed, Lifelong Fans . We capture the hearts, minds and stomachs of our guests with every\\nmeal. Our menu features something for everyone and appeals to a broad demographic, which enables our restaurants to thrive and\\ngenerate strong and balanced volumes across multiple dayparts, weekdays and occasions. No matter the location, our fans are\\nbun-believably obsessed! Guests cake shake their way in for our Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, char-grilled burgers,\\ncheese fries, fresh salads and famous chocolate cake. Our new restaurant openings draw massive crowds of passionate fans with lines\\nstretching around the block.\\nEnergetic Restaurant Atmosphere that Engages the Senses. While our operating model is focused on getting delicious, made-to-order\\nfood to our guests quickly, our atmosphere makes the experience more than a delicious meal. When guests walk into a Portillo’s, they get\\nan experience completely different than a typical chain restaurant visit. Our restaurants engage all the senses to create a fun, relaxed and\\nmemorable occasion.\\nOur dining areas evoke nostalgia and local influences. No two Portillo’s are alike. Each of our restaurants has its own themed décor,\\nranging from a 1930s prohibition motif to a 1950s diner to a 1960s flower-power bus, as well as a retro automotive garage theme. The\\nperiod music ties to the theme, from ragtime to doo wop to disco. No detail is too small, be it lighting, signage or even the stars subtly\\nsparkling on the ceiling. Each restaurant also draws design elements from the local community. The layouts create spaces comfortable for\\nindividual diners, families, large groups, and even wedding parties.\\nBeyond the space itself, the energy of a Portillo’s is unique. Our guests can see into our open kitchens, where their meals are prepared\\nright before their eyes. The smells of burgers broiling, french fries frying, and beef simmering emanate from the kitchen. Each completed\\nmeal is announced with a fun rhyme (“Number two, we got you”; “Number seven, welcome to Portillo’s heaven”). But the most important\\nelement of the energy is the enthusiasm of the scores of guests who are all excited to be there and enjoying their Portillo’s. We want\\nevery guest that visits to leave with good memories, a satiated appetite and a desire to return.\\nOur Food\\n'),\n",

Our menu features unrivaled Chicago-style street food and all-American favorites — something for everyone! We're known for\\nour famous Chicago-style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches, chopped salad, cheese fries, homemade chocolate cake, and chocolate cake\\nshake. Our Italian beef is slow-roasted for four hours, thinly sliced, and served on freshly-baked French bread. Then, it's dipped in hot\\ngravy made with our homemade blend of seasonings that we've been perfecting for 60 years. Our Chicago-style hot dogs feature\\nmustard, relish, freshly chopped onion, sliced red-ripe tomatoes, a kosher pickle and sport peppers piled high onto a perfectly steamed\\npoppy seed bun, all finished with a few shakes of savory celery salt. Guests also love our craveable crinkle-cut french fries which are\\ncooked in beef tallow, resulting in a perfectly salted, crispy outside with a soft inside. Lastly, for those craving something sweet, our\\nfamous homemade fluffy chocolate cakes are baked with love each morning in every restaurant and generously iced with rich chocolate\\nfrosting.\\nCommitment to Quality. Our made-to-order food is prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and our commitment to quality can be\\nseen in every item on the menu. We have been perfecting our menu for 60 years, and we are constantly seeking ways to further enhance\\nthe quality and desirability of our offerings.\\nMenu Innovation. We intend to drive traffic through truly craveable foods that can be made with a Portillo’s spin. New menu items are\\nintroduced when we believe they will offer superior guest satisfaction and typically coincide with the removal of an existing menu item to\\nensure a manageable menu size, allowing our team members to maintain the operational efficiency that enables our high volumes and\\nconsistently high quality offerings. Recent examples of new menu items include our Spicy Chicken Sandwich featuring our proprietary\\nspicy giardiniera sauce, launched in 2021, the Plant-based Garden Dog, launched in 2022, and our Rodeo Burger, launched in 2023,\\nfeaturing our homemade barbecue sauce and premium bacon. The Rodeo Burger combines existing ingredients in a unique way , while\\nhighlighting our improved ingredients, such as bacon. We also offer seasonal shakes and specialty cakes to complement our existing\\nmenu.\\nIn 2023 , we opened our Innovation Center, a test kitchen that allows us to explore new menu items and refinements to our operational\\nprocedures. Our teams leverage this space to efficiently explore new opportunities as we continue to grow.\\nOur Sales Channels\\nOur restaurants are thoughtfully designed for both their variety of access modes and the overall guest experience.\\nDrive-Thru. Our restaurants are built with double lane drive-thrus staffed with engaging attendants that ensure a pleasant and efficient\\nexperience with all food made to order.\\nDine-In. Our restaurant dining rooms are elaborately decorated with timeless, nostalgic designs inspired by the local community. Our\\ndining areas feature a variety of flexible seating arrangements designed to accommodate single diners, couples, families and large\\ngroups. Guests dining in our restaurants wait in an ordering line to place their order and walk up to a designated pick-up area when their\\norder is called.\\nCarryout. Guests placing a carryout order can order at the restaurant, on our website, through our app, or through certain third-party\\nplatforms and walk into the restaurant to pick up their order at our dedicated pickup shelves.\\nDelivery. We have established partnerships with multiple third-party delivery providers.\\nCatering Offerings. Our catering offerings include buffet-style packages of our ready-to-eat favorites like Italian beef, sausages and\\nmeatballs, gourmet salads, pastas and whole cakes. We also sell “Take & Make” offerings – a series of catering items and packages\\ndesigned for convenient, at-home preparation by our guests. For impromptu gatherings, we offer “Fast Packs,” which are convenient\\npackages of our most popular menu items, prewrapped and ready to top, which can be prepared and delivered quickly. We have also\\nadded in-house delivery capability to fulfill catering orders through our team members.\\nDirect Shipping Offerings. Our direct shipping offerings include some of our most popular menu items, including Italian beef (8 sandwich\\nor 20 sandwich pack), Chicago-style hot dogs (10 or 50 pack), sausages, chocolate cake and tamales.\\nOur Growth Strategies\\nExpand and Strengthen Our Restaurant Base . We are in the early stages of our nationwide growth plan, with 84 locations across ten\\nstates as of December 31, 2023, including C&O . Since 2015, we have opened new restaurants at a compounded annual growth rate of\\napproximately 9.2%. In fiscal 2023, we opened 12 new restaurants. Over the long term, we aim to increase our number of restaurants by\\napproximately 12% to 15% annually. Our near-term restaurant growth strategy is focused on leveraging our proven unit economic model\\nprimarily in markets outside\\nChicagoland with favorable macro-economic tailwinds where we already have a presence. Particularly, our short-term focus is in the\\nSunbelt, with growth across markets in Arizona, Texas, and Florida. Simultaneously, we will continue to fill-in Chicagoland and adjacent\\nmarkets as opportunities come available. Over the past year, our development function has made great strides in creating scalable,\\nrepeatable processes, giving us confidence as we grow nationally.\\n\"),\n",

Of the 900 domestic restaurants, we project 800 to be full-scale restaurants and 100 to be pick-up/walk-up models. We see these\\ncompany-operated full-scale restaurants as our largest opportunity moving forward. At the same time, we continue to evaluate innovative\\noperating models. On the heels of opening a second Portillo’s Pickup location, we will continue to analyze where these, and other\\noperating models such as urban walk-ups, airports and campuses, fit within our growth trajectory to add sales, manage cannibalization,\\nand provide additional pipeline growth.\\nWe are continuously evaluating evolving consumer preferences and footprint optimization of our restaurants. In the past, our restaurants\\nwere over 10,000 square feet and had 105-foot production lines. Restaurants built in 2023 are approximately 7,700 square feet with a\\n65-foot production line. In the future, we are planning for restaurants generally in the range of 5,500 to 6,000 square feet with an\\napproximate 47-foot production line. Overall, we are committed to improving the experience for our guests and team members. The\\nevolution of our restaurants has come as a three-stage process. Stage One focuses on retrofitting our existing restaurant base. These\\nretrofits involve adding a \"Grab & Go\" area, which includes desserts, bottled water and Portillo\\'s retail merchandise. This area previously\\nhoused our salad-make line, but we merged our production lines, gaining efficiencies along the way. We also shifted our beverage\\nstations to be self-serve for our guests. Stage Two is what we call \"Kitchen \\'23\" and is improving the efficiency in our new builds by\\nreducing the square footage, reducing the length of the production line, lowering equipment costs and enhancing our off-premise area\\nwith drive thru doors. Stage Three is what we refer to as \"Restaurant of the Future\" which will bring the square footage down to 5,500 to\\n6,000 square feet and a 47-foot production line, all without compromising our ability to achieve our industry leading average unit volume\\n(\"AUV\"). When we move to a box of this size, we will need less than our typically two-acre site to build, which will create more real estate\\npossibilities. Further, these enhancements reduce conveyance and increase productivity.\\nIncrease Our Same-Restaurant Sales. We aim to continue delivering an outstanding value proposition to our guests and enhance our\\nguest experience to grow our volumes. We believe the following initiatives will drive same-restaurant sales growth.\\n• \\nDeliver a Consistently Outstanding Guest Experience Across Order Channels . Portillo’s remains committed to offering industry-\\nleading experiences across our traditional sales channels, while continuing to grow and innovate in growth sales channels.\\nDine-in provides the best Portillo’s experience, so we strive for our dine-in experience to represent the heart of Portillo’s and our\\ncompany values of Family, Greatness, Energy, and Fun. In our drive-thru, we strive to maintain top performance in the industry\\nacross speed, service, and accuracy. In new markets, we show new guests the value and efficiency of our drive-thrus. In our\\nsales channels of digital pickup, delivery, and catering we have made great strides operationally that will allow us to win additional\\nmarket share.\\n• \\nProtect our Incredible Value Proposition. Experience, service, and food quality define value in our brand, but maintaining a strong\\nprice point remains a high priority given how broadly we compete in the restaurant industry. Our teams consistently monitor price\\npoints across the many segments and occasions that are relevant to our guests. We will continue our price laggard strategy\\ncombined with a focus on operational excellence to succeed moving forward.\\n• \\nPurposeful Menu Enhancements . We are constantly studying ways to further enhance our existing offerings while thoughtfully\\nadding new high-quality items. We are also disciplined in maintaining the size of our menu, ensuring consistency in execution\\nwhile maintaining the variety that helps drive our industry-leading volumes. For example, in 2023, we launched our Rodeo Burger,\\nan item that combines existing ingredients in a unique way, enhanced the guest experience, and provided a benefit to average\\nticket price and profit margin. We believe this purposeful innovation drives increased guest frequency and reinforces the everyday\\nvalue proposition that is key to our success. Moving forward, we will continue to consider menu enhancements to re-invigorate\\nour core guests while drawing in new guests.\\n• \\nDrive Brand Awareness and Trial Through Marketing. We believe the best way to market Portillo’s is to have people try our food.\\nWe drive awareness and trial through our grassroots local restaurant marketing team, by utilizing our Beef Bus food truck to\\npromote new restaurants, and by producing creative and engaging marketing content. Our goal is to harness brand love and\\nspread it far and wide. We do so by leaning on influencers and traditional media to spread our messages. We use a full suite of\\ncommunication channels, such as email, X (formerly known as \"Twitter\"), Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and other platforms to\\nspread our message to different customer segments.\\n◦ \\nIn 2023, we partnered with the town of Bacon, Indiana to launch our new Rodeo Burger. We invited digital content\\ncreators and traditional press to join us in Bacon for a “Bacon Rodeo,” featuring Bacon Burgers served out of our Beef\\nBus food truck. The local “Lick Creek Band” was on hand to perform and even performed a custom Portillo’s song to\\ncommemorate the event. This activity allowed us to produce several months’ worth of digital content, leading to a\\nsuccessful launch of our new burger.\\n◦ \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we debuted a new ad campaign in Chicagoland called, “Portillo’s. It always sounds good.”\\nIn addition to showing off our delicious food, the campaign incorporated sounds from within a Portillo’s restaurant – the\\nsound of a saltshaker over our French fries, the crispy crunch of our onion rings, and the sound of our team members\\nrhyming while handing out orders. The ad campaign consisted of commercials, billboards, and partnerships with several\\ndigital media outlets, such as Barstool Sports, to reach our guests across the Chicagoland. The campaign drove\\nincremental traffic to our restaurants and our guests loved the creative ads.\\nLeverage Our Infrastructure to Drive Profitability. Our attractive business model generates strong operating margins and cash flow.\\nWe constantly focus on restaurant-level operations while ensuring that we do not sacrifice the quality and experience for which we are\\nknown. Our strong average unit volumes and operational focus allow us to manage variable costs and leverage fixed costs. We believe\\n'),\n",

In addition,\\nwe have made and continue to make significant investments at the corporate level, such as the implementation of a new enterprise\\nresource planning system, which we will leverage in the future.\\nOur Team – Human Capital Management\\nOur team member base, as of December 31, 2023, consisted of 8,180 team members. This included 190 Restaurant Support Center\\n(“RSC”) team members, 439 res taurant managers, assistant general managers, and general managers, and 7,455 restaurant hourly team\\nmembers in positions such as crew chief, training lead, food production and guest services. We also have 85 hourly team members,\\nwhich also includes crew chiefs, and 11 managers and above at our commissaries. Our restaurant team members are not covered by any\\ncollective bargaining agreements. On April 13, 2023, certain of our team members at one of our commissaries voted in favor of being\\nrepresented by a union. We filed objections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") on April 19, 2023, asserting\\nthat the union and its agent\\'s promises prevented a free and fair election. We have appealed to the NLRB to set aside the election results.\\nOur Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital programs. The Compensation Committee, with\\ninput from management and an independent third-party compensation consultant, has responsibility for administering and approving\\ncompensation, including our incentive and equity-based plans for executive officers. We discuss talent and succession plans annually for\\nkey positions and levels including the executive team. We have implemented and are executing several initiatives to support our\\nobjectives to attract, develop and retain team members.\\nValues-Driven, People-Centered Culture . In 2023, Portillo’s was selected for the second year in a row by QSR Magazine as one of the\\nBest Brands to Work For. We believe this reflects our conviction that our people are the Heart of Portillo’s. We attract, hire and develop\\ngreat people who turn their obsession for our brand into a profession. Our team members are passionate about our food, love our guests,\\nand call their teammates “family.” We are proud that Portillo\\'s family is both diverse and inclusive. We strive to foster a sense of\\nindividuality, safety, support, belonging and fairness through inclusive practices in talent acquisition, talent management, total rewards and\\nlearning and development.\\nThis people-centric culture is centered on working together to create a fun, energetic atmosphere while living our values:\\nFamily\\nWe work together to make everyone feel at home, and we step up when someone needs help.\\nGreatness\\nWe are obsessed with being the best and work hard to continuously improve. Our greatness is rooted in Quality, Service,\\nAttitude and Cleanliness (“QSAC”).\\nEnergy\\nWe move with urgency and passion, while maintaining attention to detail.\\nFun\\nWe entertain our guests, we connect authentically, and we make each other smile.\\nThese values extend beyond our restaurants, to every Portillo\\'s team member. Living these values reinforces the culture we’re proud to\\nhave built. It’s why we are passionate about attracting and selecting team members who are aligned with our purpose and values, as well\\nas why we established an employee value proposition centered around culture. It’s also why our team members are our best\\nambassadors and why we’ve seen success with our referral program.\\nLeadership Development. We provide a full spectrum of resources, from skill building to leadership development, in the organization.\\nOur philosophy is to develop people to be ready before a position is open, as opposed to waiting for a position to be open and then\\ntraining them. We view this investment as fundamental to our growth, building a pipeline of leaders for our future.\\nWe are committed to continuing education and providing ways for individuals to build their talents. Portillo’s has invested in LinkedIn\\nLearning for all hourly Crew Chiefs, Restaurant Management, Commissary Crew Chiefs and RSC Team Members. This initiative allows us\\nto give additional learning and development opportunities above and beyond job skills or initial leadership development. We have also\\npartnered with Better Up Coaching to give our leaders feedback and opportunities for personal growth.\\nTo ensure everyone has access to our leadership program, we continue to hold quarterly career interest days in all markets, where\\ninterested team members hear about opportunities within the Company and how to apply for development programs. The creation of a\\nstrong talent pipeline while retaining successful team members is a top priority. In 2023, we restructured our annual performance review\\nprocess to reflect the importance of exhibiting seven leadership traits that we expect every leader to embody to be successful in our\\norganization. Our growth, development, and retention strategies focus on these leadership traits to build skills to be used both\\nprofessionally and personally. We work with team members and managers to build individual development plans with training and\\nexperiences, and we hold regularly scheduled development programs throughout the year for each level of leadership. Further, we hold\\nbi-annual talent and succession planning summits to identify and support individuals with career pathing and development opportunities.\\n'),\n",

We aspire to provide an unrivaled experience for every team member during their journey with Portillo’s.\\nCreating lifelong memories for our team members and guests is paramount to the overall experience. We believe in our team members\\nhaving a voice to share their ideas, feedback and contribute to organizational success. We continue to partner with Gallup to implement\\nour EverEngaged survey to gather, listen to and act on team member feedback. We conduct this survey annually to measure\\nimprovement and areas of focus. In 2023, our engagement score continued to improve with statistical significance while the restaurant\\nindustry remained flat. Our engagement results for multi-unit and general managers continue to be top quartile. Our team members\\nreflected that they know what is expected of them at work and strongly agree they have what they need to do their jobs. These both are\\nfoundational to an individual’s engagement and success. In addition to the survey, we regularly hold roundtable discussions with team\\nmembers and stay interviews with leaders to gain insights into ways we can cultivate an energizing, collaborative work environment.\\nAdditionally, we conduct an annual career aspiration survey for all RSC team members, crew chiefs, and field managers to understand\\ntheir aspirations in development, career pathing, and what they need to succeed.\\nWe have also prioritized a flexible work environment, addressing life-work flexibility and balance across our different workplaces. Our\\nscheduling system allows hourly team members to align their work schedule with their personal schedule, as well as submit schedules,\\ntime-off requests and trade shifts. For our RSC team members, we provide a flexible work environment. Quarterly, we hold engagement-\\nfocused RSC culture weeks to bring the team together for connecting, recognition and development. In the spirit of continuing education,\\nwe also have a \"no meeting\" policy for Friday afternoons. Instead, our team members can use this time for professional development or\\nfocused work time. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, team members can also take this time for personal use and get an early start\\nto the weekend.\\nTotal Rewards. The physical, financial, and mental well-being of our team members remains our top priority, and we continue to invest in\\ntheir success. We believe in a total rewards philosophy of providing top quartile pay in our restaurants, especially across our leadership\\npositions. We remain focused on compensating our team members equally across gender and race/ethnicity.\\nThis commitment is evidenced by our investment in our compensation packages and robust suite of benefit offerings. In 2023, we\\nincreased hourly pay across many of our geographies and for some of our restaurant management positions. Additionally, in 2023, we\\nenhanced our benefits package by offering a variety of voluntary benefit options for team members to choose from including pet\\ninsurance, identity theft protection, critical illness coverage, and accident and hospital indemnity protection. These additional offerings\\nallow our team members the flexibility to customize their coverages to best fit their needs. We also enhanced our dental plan offerings\\nand expanded access to additional medical plans for our restaurant team members. To prioritize overall well-being, we also continue to\\nenhance our wellness platform to provide fitness and other programs that promote wellness of the whole individual. In 2023, we also\\nmade enhancements to our paid leave policy.\\nWe believe all of our team members should act like owners of the Company, and we are committed to providing all team members with an\\nownership opportunity through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"), internally referred to as \"Beef Stock.\" Eligible employees\\ncan contribute up to 15% of their gross base earnings for purchases under the ESPP through regular payroll deductions, subject to an\\nannual maximum dollar amount. In 2023, we issued 29,808 shares (net of shares withheld for taxes) under the ESPP. In addition to our\\nBeef Stock program, all restaurant team members who are newly hired as or promoted to General Manager become eligible for our\\nlong-term equity incentive plan. In 2023, many of our leaders received annual grants providing our team with opportunities to own shares,\\nwhich we believe supports retention of key team members.\\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging. At Portillo’s, we embrace Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (\"DEIB\") through our\\ncore values of Family, Greatness, Energy and Fun. These values are ingrained in everything we do as a company, and they guide how we\\nsupport our Portillo\\'s family.\\nWe launched our DEIB initiative, which is sponsored by two members from our executive leadership team and one sponsor from our\\nBoard of Directors. It is then guided by a DEIB Advisory Group, which reviews programs ideated by our 10-member DEIB committee. This\\ncross-company working group is building the framework for programs that support a diverse workforce. This includes increased\\nawareness and education of our team members. We\\'ve also expanded our recruiting efforts to encourage members of underserved\\ncommunities, such as military veterans, to join the Portillo\\'s family.\\nHeart of Portillo\\'s Foundation. We care deeply about our people and believe that by taking care of our team members, they will in turn\\ntake care of our guests. In 2023, the “Heart of Portillo’s Fund,” an IRC section 501(c)(3) charitable fund raised over $300,000 to provide\\nemergency assistance to team members. In 2023, the fund awarded over 60 grants and has provided support to team members for\\nexpenses following illness or injury, the unexpected death of a family member and other financial hardships.\\nOur Sourcing and Supply Chain\\nWe are committed to maintaining our high-quality food standards through fresh ingredients that meet our stringent specifications. We\\npartner with a variety of companies that are similarly focused on producing and providing high quality products.\\nOur supply chain approach is based on alignment with key strategic partners that are identified through a comprehensive evaluation\\nprocess to ensure our standards and expectations are met on a continual basis.

As part of our risk assessment strategy, the supply chain team identifies areas critical to supporting the restaurants and\\nexecutes any necessary adjustments or alternate programs.\\nSuppliers and distribution partners are managed under both a code of conduct and a pricing protocol that provides transparent insight to\\ncosting mechanisms. In addition, we engage directly with manufacturers to ensure compliance with negotiated contract pricing and\\nrequisite volume expectations.\\nDistribution. Our distribution network is comprised of several independently operated partners aligned under the UniPro umbrella, the\\nlargest food service distribution cooperative in the United States. This strategy affords us the opportunity to align with right-sized\\norganizations that are dedicated to us which allows us to leverage volume and scale for a competitive advantage and exceptional\\ncustomer service.\\nCommissaries. We operate two commissaries to supply our network of restaurants with our signature beef, peppers and gravy for our\\nItalian beef sandwiches and ensure product consistency and quality. These ingredients are shipped to our restaurants where our team\\nmembers will finish the preparation in our kitchens to serve our guests.\\nQuality Systems. Quality and food safety are paramount to protecting our brand and are treated with the utmost priority. Our supplier and\\ndistribution partners participate in third-party audits to ensure all applicable quality system expectations are being met. Our restaurant\\nlocations are audited for food safety and quality compliance through a combination of third-party organizations and the Portillo's managed\\nquality and food systems team. Our commissaries also undergo food safety and quality audits on a regular basis.\\nWhile we are actively working to mitigate any effects of supply chain constraints, such constraints could result in higher food and\\nbeverage cost associated with general increases in input price levels as well as increased product substitutions and elevated freight costs.\\nOur Competition\\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete primarily with quick service and fast casual concepts, and to a\\nlesser extent, full-service restaurants. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition in these segments\\nincludes a variety of small locally owned restaurants, medium-sized regional restaurant concepts, and larger national restaurant concepts\\nthat provide some combination of dine-in, carry-out, drive-thru and delivery services to their guests. We believe competition with these\\nrestaurants is based primarily on quality and innovation in the food products offered, price and perceived value, quality of service\\nexperience (including technological and other innovations), speed of service, personnel, advertising and other marketing efforts, brand\\nidentification, restaurant location, and image and attractiveness of the restaurants.\\nThe restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic\\ntrends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power. We\\ncompete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly\\npersonnel and suitable real estate sites. In addition, expanding product offerings at fast casual and quick-service restaurants and the\\nconvenience of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive\\nalternatives or reduce the frequency of their restaurant visits. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.\\nOur Intellectual Property\\nOur intellectual property includes our trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office\\n(including Portillo’s ® and other names used by our restaurants), the trade dress of our restaurants, our websites and domain names\\n(including our website at portillos.com and other websites and domain names used by our restaurants) and other unregistered intellectual\\nproperty. We take steps to enforce and maintain our intellectual property, but infringement, validity challenges and other risks may\\nadversely affect or even eliminate our intellectual property.\\nGovernmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulation, including those relating to, among others, public health and\\nsafety, nutritional content labeling, zoning and fire codes, environmental protection, and employment regulations. Failure to obtain or\\nretain food or other licenses and registrations or exemptions would adversely affect the operations of restaurants.\\nThe development of additional restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to zoning,\\nland use, water quality and retention, and environment. We believe federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material\\neffect on operations, but more stringent and varied requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning, land use and\\nenvironmental factors, among others, could delay construction and increase development costs for new restaurants.\\nWe are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 and various federal, state and local\\nlaws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt versus non-exempt, overtime, unemployment tax rates, paid leave, workers’\\n\"),\n",

On October 25, 2021, the Company completed its IPO of 23,310,810 shares of the Company\\'s\\nClass A common stock (including 3,040,540 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) at an offering price of\\n$20.00 per share.\\nSecondary Offerings\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock at\\nan offering price of $21.05 per share. On April 5, 2023, the Underwriter exercised its overallotment option in part, to purchase an\\nadditional 620,493 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock at an offering price of $21.05 per share (collectively the \"Q1 2023\\nSecondary Offering and\\nOverallotment Option\"). We used all of the net proceeds from the Q1 2023 Secondary Offering and Overallotment Option to purchase LLC\\nUnits and corresponding shares of Class B common stock from certain pre-IPO LLC Members and to repurchase shares of Class A\\ncommon stock from the shareholders of the entities treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes that held LLC Units prior to the\\nTransactions (\"Blocker Companies\") at a price per LLC Unit or share of Class A common stock, as applicable, equal to the public offering\\nprice per share of Class A common stock, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The proceeds from the Q1 2023 Secondary\\nOffering and Overallotment Option were used to (i) purchase 2,269,776 existing shares of Class A common stock from the shareholders\\nof the Blocker Companies and (ii) redeem 6,350,717 LLC Units held by the pre-IPO LLC Members. In connection with the redemption,\\n6,350,717 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the pre-IPO LLC Members and canceled and the Company received\\n6,350,717 newly-issued LLC Units, increasing the Company\\'s total ownership interest in Portillo\\'s OpCo. As a result, Portillo’s did not\\nreceive any proceeds from the offering, and the total number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock did not\\nchange; however, the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock increased by the same number of the canceled shares of\\nClass B common stock.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 76.1% of Portillo\\'s OpCo and the pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 23.9% of\\nPortillo\\'s OpCo.\\nSee the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements And Supplementary Data\" for more information\\nabout the above-mentioned transactions.\\nAvailable Information\\nOur website is located at www.portillos.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investors.portillos.com.

Additionally, we may be unable to offset a portion or even all of a future cost increase through menu price increases.\\nCompetitive conditions may limit our menu pricing flexibility and implementing menu price increases may change our guests’ visit\\nfrequencies or purchasing patterns. Our industry depends on consumer discretionary spending and is affected by changes in consumer\\ntastes, and macro- and micro-economic conditions (including economic downturns, inflation or increased food or energy costs). Factors\\nsuch as traffic patterns, weather, fuel prices, local demographics, local regulations and the competitive landscape may adversely affect the\\nperformances of our individual locations.\\nOur restaurants are primarily located in high-activity trade areas that often contain retail, lifestyle, and entertainment centers. We depend\\non high visitor rates in these trade areas to attract guests to our restaurants. A decline in traffic at these locations for a sustained period\\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations (collectively, \"our Results\").\\nWe may fail to open new restaurants or establish new markets or our new restaurants may not perform as well as anticipated,\\nmay not be profitable, or may close.\\nOpening and profitably operating new restaurants in existing and new markets is key to our growth. Over the long term, we aim to\\nincrease our number of restaurants by approximately 12% to 15% annually. We may struggle to identify target markets, we may not be\\nable to open our planned new restaurants within budget or on a timely basis, and our new restaurants may not perform as well as\\nanticipated. New restaurant success is affected by several factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability to secure\\nenough appropriate and attractive sites, and complete construction in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\\nWe may open restaurants in geographic markets where we have little or no prior operating experience. Moreover, consumer recognition of\\nour brand has been important to the success of our existing restaurants, and our concept may have limited appeal in new markets.\\nRestaurants in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit and may have higher construction, occupancy and\\noperating costs than existing restaurants. New restaurants in or near markets with existing restaurants could have a material adverse\\neffect on sales at these existing restaurants. Failure on our part to recognize or respond to these challenges may adversely affect the\\nsuccess of new restaurants and could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nSome of our restaurants have higher-than-normal sales volumes during the initial startup period, and our Restaurant-Level Adjusted\\nEBITDA Margins are generally lower in the first 12 months of operation. In new markets, the period before average sales stabilize is less\\npredictable because of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers’ limited awareness of our brand. In addition, our AUV and\\nsame-restaurant sales may not increase at the rates our existing restaurants have achieved over the past several years. Our ability to\\noperate new restaurants profitably and increase AUV and same-restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond\\nour control.\\nWe employ operating and financial targets, but new restaurants may not meet these targets or may take longer than anticipated to do so.\\nIf our new restaurants do not perform as planned, it could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nFurther, our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems (collectively, our\\n“Infrastructure”) may be inadequate to support our planned expansion. We may not enhance our Infrastructure quickly enough or\\neffectively hire, train and retain team members, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results. If we experience a decline in\\nfinancial performance, we may limit, delay or discontinue restaurant openings, or we may decide to close unprofitable restaurants.\\nOur growth plans and ongoing capital expenditure (\"capex\") needs require us to spend capital, which may not be readily\\navailable.\\nOur growth strategy depends on opening new restaurants using cash flows from operations. However, these cash flows may be\\ninsufficient to meet our needs. If cash is allocated ineffectively among our projects, or if any initiatives are unsuccessful, we may\\nexperience reduced profitability and we may need to delay, limit or eliminate planned restaurant openings, which could have a material\\nadverse effect on our Results.\\nAs our restaurants mature, they require capital expenditures to remain competitive and maintain our brand standard. If we cannot fund\\ncapital expenditures using cash flows from operations, funds will need to be borrowed or otherwise obtained or capex investments will be\\ndelayed or eliminated, which could make those restaurants less attractive to guests and materially, adversely affect the business.\\n'),\n",

As our restaurant count increases and we\\nexpand into new markets, we expect to increase our marketing investment. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, we may incur expenses\\nwithout the benefit of higher revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nOur marketing efforts rely heavily on the use of social media. Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media, and new\\nsocial media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. We must\\ncontinuously evolve our social media strategies to maintain customer mindshare and brand relevance, particularly given the rise in digital\\nfocus among customers. We also invest in other marketing initiatives across digital channels and build customer awareness of,\\nengagement with, and loyalty to our brand. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without higher sales or\\nincreased brand recognition.\\nLaws and regulations governing the use of these platforms and devices continue to evolve. The failure by us or our agents to abide by\\napplicable laws and regulations could subject us to investigations, lawsuits, liability, fines or other penalties and have a material adverse\\neffect on our Results.

Incidents or reports of\\nfood-borne or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, food contamination or tampering, team member hygiene and cleanliness\\nfailures, improper team member conduct, or guests spreading illness while at our restaurants could lead to product liability or other claims.\\nSuch incidents or reports could negatively affect our brand and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nWe cannot guarantee that our food safety controls, procedures and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety and public\\nhealth issues at our restaurants. There is no guarantee that our restaurant locations will maintain the high levels of internal controls and\\ntraining we require. Some food-borne illness incidents could be caused by third-party food suppliers or delivery services or during guest\\ntakeout or catered events. The risk may affect multiple restaurant locations. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may\\ndevelop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, any of which could give rise to retroactive claims or allegations.\\nOne or more food safety instances in one of our restaurants could negatively affect sales at nearby or even all our restaurants, especially\\nif highly publicized.\\nOther restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to food-borne illness incidents that have had material adverse impacts on their\\noperations, and it’s possible we could suffer a similar impact if a similar incident occurred at one of our restaurants. Additionally, even if\\nfood-borne illnesses were not identified at our restaurants, our restaurant sales could be adversely affected if instances of food-borne\\nillnesses at other restaurant chains were highly publicized.\\nWe face significant competition for guests, and our inability to compete effectively may affect our traffic, our sales and our\\noperating profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete directly and indirectly with national, regional and local limited-service (e.g.,\\nquick service or fast casual) and full-service restaurants on food quality, brand recognition, service, price and value, convenience, design\\nand location. Some competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources, and many are\\nwell-established in our target markets.

In the past, some of our competitors have implemented promotional programs that provide price discounts or\\nreward programs, and they may continue to do so in the future. If we cannot compete effectively, our traffic, restaurant sales and\\nrestaurant operating profit margins could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results. Should our competitors\\nincrease spending on marketing and other initiatives or our marketing expenditures decrease, or our advertising, promotions, and\\nrestaurant designs and locations be less effective than our competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our Results .\\nOur restaurant base is geographically concentrated in the Midwestern United States, and we could be negatively affected by\\nconditions specific to that region.\\nOur restaurants in the Midwestern United States represented approximately 77% of our restaurants as of December 31, 2023. Our\\nrestaurants in the Chicagoland area represented approximately 49% of our restaurants as of December 31, 2023. Adverse changes in\\ndemographic, unemployment, economic, regulatory or weather conditions in the Midwestern United States have had, and may continue to\\nhave, material adverse effects on our Results. As a result of our concentration in this market, we have been, and in the future may be,\\ndisproportionately affected by conditions in this geographic area compared to other chain restaurants with a more distributed national\\nfootprint.\\nOur competitors could open additional restaurants in the Midwestern United States, which could result in reduced market share for us in\\nthis key geographic region, which could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nDamage to our reputation and negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nOur reputation and the perception of our brand are critical to our success. Any incident that erodes our consumer loyalty could\\nsignificantly damage our business. We may be adversely affected by negative publicity relating to food quality, the safety, sanitation and\\nwelfare of our restaurant facilities, guest complaints or litigation, health inspection scores, integrity of our suppliers’ food processing and\\nother policies, practices and procedures, team member relationships and welfare or other matters at one or more of our restaurants.\\nFurthermore, similar negative publicity or occurrences with respect to other restaurants could also decrease our guest traffic and have a\\nsimilar material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the volume of restaurant commentary has increased dramatically with the\\nproliferation of social media platforms. Negative publicity may adversely affect us or some or all of our restaurants, regardless of whether\\nallegations are valid, and we may not be able to respond effectively. For example, we, or other restaurant companies generally, have and\\ncould again come under criticism from animal rights and welfare activists for our business practices or those of our suppliers. Such\\ncriticisms could impair our brand, our restaurant sales, our hiring, and our expansion plans. If we changed our practices because of\\nconcerns about animal welfare, or in response to such criticisms, our costs might increase, or we may have to change our suppliers or our\\nmenu. A similar risk exists with respect to food service businesses unrelated to us if customers mistakenly associate such unrelated\\nbusinesses with our operations. Team member claims against us based on, among other things, alleged wage and hour violations,\\ndiscrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could\\nadversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources from more productive initiatives. A significant increase in the\\nnumber of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nThe digital and delivery business, and expansion thereof, is uncertain and subject to risk.\\nWe believe digital investments to be a critical differentiator for our business, driving greater and more frequent engagement with new and\\nexisting customers. As the digital space continues to evolve, our technology must also evolve to stay competitive. If we do not maintain\\nand innovate competitive digital systems, our digital business and sales may be adversely affected as we lose guests to competitors. We\\nrely on third-parties for our ordering and payment platforms. Services performed by these third-parties have been, and could be in the\\nfuture, damaged or interrupted by technological issues or cyberattacks, which could negatively impact our sales and harm our reputation.\\nAs availability of food delivery services increase, we understand the importance of meeting our guests’ needs. We have invested in\\nmarketing to promote our delivery partnerships, which could negatively impact our profitability if that channel does not continue to expand.\\nWe rely on third-parties to fulfill delivery orders in a timely and professional fashion. If these third-party delivery companies cease doing\\nbusiness with us, do not continue their relationship with us on favorable terms, or cannot make their scheduled deliveries (including a\\nshortage of drivers), it may have a negative impact on our sales or revenue. Errors in providing adequate delivery services may result in\\nguest dissatisfaction, which could also result in guest attrition, loss in sales and damage to our brand image. Additionally, as with any\\nthird-party handling food, such delivery services increase the risk of food tampering while in transit. We developed sealed packaging to\\nprovide some deterrence against such potential food tampering, but some risk remains.\\nThird-party food delivery services are competitive. If our delivery partners fail to effectively compete with other third-party delivery\\nproviders, our delivery business may suffer, resulting in a loss of sales. If any third-party delivery provider we partner with experiences\\ndamage to their brand image, we may also see ramifications due to our partnership with them.\\nPortillo's Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 5\\n\"),\n",

In addition, under the U.S. Patient Protection and\\nAffordable Care Act (“ACA”), we must provide affordable coverage, as defined in ACA, to eligible team members, or make a payment per\\nteam member based on ACA's affordability criteria.

We could also become subject to\\nfines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state\\nimmigration compliance laws. As a result of such events, we could experience adverse publicity that may negatively impact our brand and\\nmay make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified team members. These factors could materially adversely affect our Results.\\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by team members, consumers, suppliers, shareholders or others through private actions,\\nclass actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and\\nregulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. In recent years, restaurant companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits,\\nincluding class actions, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment conditions, discrimination and\\nsimilar matters. Some lawsuits have resulted in substantial damage awards. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time\\nalleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime\\neligibility of managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Whether or not claims against us are valid or whether we are found liable,\\nclaims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and result in increases in our insurance\\npremiums. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and sales. Although we believe we maintain\\nadequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover all potential liabilities with respect to\\nthese or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage or any adverse publicity resulting from claims\\ncould have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nOn April 13, 2023, certain of our team members at one of our commissaries voted in favor of being represented by a union. We filed\\nobjections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board on April 19th, 2023, asserting that the union and its agent's promises\\nprevented a free and fair election. We have appealed to the NLRB to set aside the election results. Although we have not received other\\npetitions to unionize, it is possible that additional team members may choose to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a\\nsignificant number of our team members were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different\\nfrom our current compensation arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our Results. In addition, a labor dispute involving\\nsome or all our team members may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes could\\nincrease our costs. Further, if we enter into a new market with unionized construction companies, or the construction companies in our\\ncurrent markets become unionized, construction and build-out costs for new restaurants in such markets could materially increase.\\nLabor quality, labor shortages or increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our Results.\\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain enough qualified team members to meet the needs of our new and\\nexisting restaurants. Competition for qualified team members in some areas could require higher wages and greater benefits. Our team\\nmembers are typically paid more than the applicable minimum wage where they work. Increases in federal or state minimum wages,\\nunemployment benefits, higher team member-turnover rates, unionization of restaurant workers, or increases in the federally-mandated or\\nstate-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated\\nwith health insurance coverage or workers’ compensation insurance) may also increase wage rates. We invest significant time and money\\nin the qualification and training of our personnel, so failure to retain team members will increase costs without improving Results. Inability\\nto recruit or retain team members could also delay new restaurant openings, could adversely impact existing restaurants, or result in\\nhigher team member turnover in existing restaurants, increasing our labor costs and adversely affecting our Results.\\nWe may be unable to increase our menu prices in order to pass future increased labor costs on to our guests, in which case our operating\\nmargins would be negatively affected. If we increase menu prices to cover increased labor costs, the higher prices could adversely affect\\ndemand for our menu items, resulting in lower sales.\\nWe are exposed to risks associated with leasing property including long-term, non-cancelable leases and potential inability to\\nrenew expiring leases.\\nMany of our restaurant leases are non-cancelable with initial terms of 10 to 20 years and typically provide for renewal options in five-year\\nincrements. Generally, our leases also require us to pay our share of the costs of real estate taxes, utilities, building operating expenses,\\ninsurance and other charges and may include rent escalations. If we close a restaurant, our lease obligations may remain, requiring,\\namong other things, payment of the rent and other costs through the lease term. In addition, as leases expire for restaurants that we\\ncontinue to operate, we may be unable to negotiate renewals on commercially acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we may close or\\nrelocate the restaurant, resulting in unanticipated construction costs, the delay or failure by the landlord to timely deliver the new\\nrestaurant location to us, and unfavorable commercial, residential or infrastructure development near our new restaurant location, among\\nother costs and risks.

The U.S. government has limited and may further limit the\\nability of companies to engage in these activities. Additionally, some device manufacturers and web browsers have implemented, or\\nannounced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking\\ntechnologies, which, if widely adopted, could result in third-party cookies and other online tracking methods becoming significantly less\\neffective. This could increase our operating costs, including new customer acquisition costs and, consequently, have a material adverse\\neffect on our Results.\\nVarious federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current or enact new laws or\\nregulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and\\nadvertising. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer\\nprotection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Each of these laws and regulations,\\nchanges thereto, and any other new laws or regulations, could require changes to our business practices or restrict our use or storage of\\npersonal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient.

Such laws and regulations may change. Failure to comply with\\napplicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. Many licenses, permits and approvals must be renewed\\nannually and may be revoked, suspended or denied renewal if governmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable\\nregulations. Difficulties or failure to obtain or maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals could adversely affect our existing\\nrestaurants and delay or result in our decision to cancel new restaurant openings, which could have a material adverse effect on our\\nResults.\\nThe development and operation of our restaurants depend, to a significant extent, on the selection of suitable sites, which are subject to\\nzoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state\\nand local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards.\\nThere is also a potential for increased regulation of certain food establishments in the United States, where compliance with a Hazard\\nAnalysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) approach would be required. The United States government continues to expand the\\nsectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. For example, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act\\n(“FSMA”), signed into law in January 2011, granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration new authority regarding the safety of the entire\\nfood system, including through increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. We anticipate that the requirements may impact our\\nindustry. Additionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that impact product availability, result in adverse\\npublicity or require us to take costly actions or otherwise impact our business. We may be required to incur additional time and resources\\nto comply with new food safety requirements made under the FSMA or other federal or state food safety regulations. Failure to comply\\nwith the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required\\nlicenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability.

CYBERSECURITY\\nRisk Management Philosophy and Strategy\\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy, we have increased our attention to cybersecurity. Responsibility for cybersecurity risk\\nmanagement is a team effort, with day-to-day oversight and management from our executive and information technology (\"IT\") teams, the\\nAudit Committee taking a more active role in setting both proactive and reactive strategies and our Board overseeing our efforts and\\nhelping to guide our strategy.\\nOur primary source of cybersecurity risk relates to security of our third-party service providers, whose activities and scale may present\\nmore desirable targets. However, we do maintain certain systems ourselves and appreciate the need to focus internally as well. We\\nmanage cybersecurity risk through a variety of tactics, including (i) the structure of our systems and platforms, (ii) the contractual terms\\nwith our third-party vendors, (iii) the proactive vulnerability assessments we conduct (or require our vendors to conduct), (iv) compliance\\nwith applicable regulations and continuous improvement around best practices, (v) mitigating user error and human vulnerabilities through\\ntraining and guidance and (vi) the placement of cybersecurity insurance policies.\\nWe employ a “Defense in Depth” strategy to protect the Company, segmenting our systems and networks so that an attack on one\\nsegment does not allow for easier compromise of other systems and networks. Within the Company, administrative access to various\\nsystems is limited so that there is no universal access if an administrator-level account is compromised.\\nWe involve our IT team when negotiating contracts that could increase our cybersecurity risk exposure, so that the team is aware of the\\nspecific risks related to a given vendor and can provide feedback and advice on the contractual provisions necessary to prevent a\\ncybersecurity incident, or in the\\n'),\n",

We negotiate with\\nour vendors about a variety of monitoring, testing, and reporting provisions so that we can work with them to better address vulnerabilities.\\nThis may include sharing SOC 1 or 2 Type 2 audit reports, conducting periodic penetration and vulnerability testing and confirmation that\\nvendors are adhering to applicable laws. We also deploy the same approach internally, and we are currently expanding our testing efforts\\nacross our servers and networks, continually monitoring access (including more formal quarterly access reviews for any systems that are\\nsubject to SOX oversight), and documenting changes via a ticketing system. In addition to tracking logins, our monitoring system is\\nequipped to respond automatically to certain triggers, taking a range of actions, from notifying administrators to locking out an account.\\nSome of this testing and monitoring is conducted in-house and some is conducted by third-party vendors.\\nAs a restaurant and public company, we are subject to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\"PCI-DSS\") and SOX\\nrequirements and we take steps to make sure that we are compliant with those regulations. We also continue to monitor evolving laws\\nand regulations related to security and privacy and look for opportunities to improve our systems based on evolving best practices in the\\nIT industry.\\nWe know that people are often the most vulnerable element in an IT ecosystem. We work with team members at all levels to educate\\nthem about evolving risks, from well-known tactics and scams (e.g., phishing) to their more sophisticated descendants (e.g., vphishing,\\nspear phishing and smishing). Team members receive training on data security and privacy practices and are included in periodic\\nawareness campaigns to test real-world responses. We are on the lookout for additional training opportunities and have recently begun\\nscheduling “tabletop” exercises to test our PCI-related responses and creating new business interruption plans. The Company also\\nemploys and enforces a number of policies to guide team member behavior and help protect against threats, covering everything from\\nregular password updates to obtaining permission to install third-party programs and use personal devices. Team member training\\nreinforces the Company’s risk management policies and procedures and the expectation that all team members will adhere to them.\\nThe Company also maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy that we believe is appropriate for a company of our size and risk profile, but\\nit is possible that it may not fully cover the costs associated with a cybersecurity incident.\\nWe do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially\\naffected our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, there is no guarantee that a future cybersecurity\\nincident would not materially affect our future strategy, results or financial condition. For a more in-depth discussion of risks associated\\nwith cybersecurity and cybersecurity insurance risks , see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\\nOversight and Execution of Our Cybersecurity Risk Strategy\\nBoth the Board and the Audit Committee play an important role in the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee\\nreceives periodic updates on the Company’s risk profile and mitigation strategies and conducts forward-looking discussions about major\\nIT changes that are planned, the risks involved and the Company\\'s potential mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee shares updates\\nwith the broader Board.

As noted\\nabove, the team conducts risk assessment activities on a regular basis. The team also liaises with cross-functional partners and outside\\nexperts, including legal counsel and consultants, and reviews applicable security frameworks (e.g., National Institute of Standards and\\nTechnology (\"NIST\")) to identify the legal requirements and industry practices and expectations that the Company’s security measures\\nshould satisfy. The Company regularly updates its practices to incorporate new best practices and strengthen compliance with SOX,\\nPCI-DSS and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements. These activities are used to develop and update the\\nCompany’s cybersecurity risk profile.\\nThe team then identifies the potential mitigation measures to address these risks, and may bring in consultants as appropriate based on\\ntheir expertise and knowledge of the Company to develop strategies that are tailored to the Company’s needs and profile. These\\nmeasures include business continuity plans (which are developed in connection with our risk management team and the users of a given\\nplatform), improving system redundancy to limit disruptions and eliminating single points of failure where possible.\\nIn addition to our ITVP, the cybersecurity portion of our IT team includes one dedicated team member and four additional team members\\nwho handle cybersecurity risks in addition to other job responsibilities.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we opened 12 new\\nrestaurants in the Arizona, Florida, Illinois, and Texas markets for a total of 84 restaurants, including a restaurant owned by C&O. In 2023,\\nwe made significant strides in Texas with the opening of four new restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.

For the year ended December 31,\\n2023, we experienced a decrease of 0.7% in labor expenses, as a percentage of revenue, compared to the year ended December 25,\\n2022 primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by higher labor utilization and additional wage investments. We strategically\\noffset these expenses through menu price increases and operational efficiencies.\\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, same-restaurant sales, operating income, net income, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and\\nAdjusted EBITDA all improved versus the prior year. We believe this improvement was the result of our ongoing efforts to deploy strategic\\npricing actions, elevate guest experiences, implement operational efficiencies, and grow our restaurant base.\\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect our overall commodity inflation to stay consistent with recent trends and are currently estimating commodity\\ninflation in the mid-single digits. Additionally, we do anticipate additional wage investments and are currently estimating mid-single digit\\nwage inflation. We will continue to strategically offset these expense increases through menu price increases and operational efficiencies.\\nDuring January of 2024, we increased certain menu prices by approximately 1.5%. We will continue to monitor our cost pressures, the\\ncompetitive landscape as well as consumer sentiment to inform our pricing decisions in the coming quarters.\\nWe believe the strength of our brand, the consistency of our operations, and the ongoing execution of a disciplined development strategy\\nall support our business model.

This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue, which\\nis attributable to an increase in average check, partially offset by a decrease in transactions.\\nOther Income, Net\\nOther income, net includes among other items, income resulting from discounts received for timely filing of sales tax returns, management\\nfee income associated with our investment in C&O, trading gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan and gains or losses on\\nasset disposals.\\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.0 million compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 25,\\n2022, an increase of $0.8 million or 407.4%.

Due to their inherent uncertainty, these judgments and estimates\\nmay be subject to change, which could materially impact future periods.\\nLiabilities Under Tax Receivable Agreement\\nAs described in \"Liquidity Upon IPO\", we are a party to the TRA under which we are contractually committed to pay certain of our pre-IPO\\nLLC Members 85% of the amount of any tax savings that we actually realize, or in some cases are deemed to realize, as a result of\\ncertain transactions. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income\\nover the term of the TRA and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the\\nterm of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA payments. Therefore, we would only\\nrecognize a liability for TRA payments if we determine it is probable that we will generate sufficient future taxable income over the term of\\nthe TRA to utilize the related tax\\n'),\n",

As of December 31, 2023, we recognized $299.8 million of liabilities relating to our obligations under the TRA, after concluding\\nthat it was probable that we would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the related tax benefits. If we determine in the future that\\nwe will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, we would de-recognize the portion of the liability related to the\\nbenefits not expected to be utilized.\\nAdditionally, we estimate the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current\\non our consolidated balance sheet. This determination is based on our estimate of taxable income for the previous fiscal year and the\\ntiming of the anticipated payments. To the extent our estimate differs from actual results, we may be required to reclassify portions of our\\nliabilities under the TRA between current and non-current. We expect a payment of $4.4 million to be made within the next 12 months.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of Portillo’s OpCo\\nand will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax liabilities, we also will incur expenses related to our operations,\\nplus payments under the TRA, which are expected to be significant. We intend to cause Portillo’s OpCo to make cash distributions to us\\nin an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course\\npayments due under the TRA. We anticipate that we will account for the income tax effects and corresponding TRA’s effects resulting\\nfrom future taxable exchanges or redemptions of LLC Units of pre-IPO LLC Members by us or Portillo’s OpCo by recognizing an increase\\nin our deferred tax assets, based on enacted tax rates at the date of the purchase or redemption.\\nThe amounts recorded for both the deferred tax assets and the liability for our obligations under the TRA were estimated at the time of the\\nIPO and secondary offerings as a reduction to shareholders’ equity, and the effects of changes in any of our estimates after this date will\\nbe included in net income (loss). Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income (loss).\\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets\\nwill be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the\\nperiods in which temporary differences become deductible. We will record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce the carrying\\nvalue of certain deferred tax assets to their respective net realizable value (if any). As of December 31, 2023, we had $184.7 million of\\ndeferred tax assets, net of the recorded valuation allowance.\\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740— Income Taxes , as it relates to accounting for uncertainties in tax positions, we recognize the tax\\nbenefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit\\nwill more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts\\nand circumstances. For the tax year ended December 31, 2023, we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits.\\nPortillo's Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 34\\n\"),\n",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nCommodity and Food Price Risks\\nWe are exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials, are\\ncommodities or are affected by the price of other commodities. Factors that affect the price of commodities are generally outside of our\\ncontrol and include raw material inputs, geopolitical events, weather conditions, currency markets and global supply and demand\\ndynamics, among other items.\\nIn order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter\\ninto purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous. St ructured programs within our organization\\nexist to mitigate adverse impacts and proactively direct risk management strategies across our portfolio of key products, services and\\nenergy platforms.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur credit facilities incur interest at a floating rate. We seek to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through our normal\\noperating and financing activities. As of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, we had a total of $309.4 million and $322.4 million,\\nrespectively, in outstanding borrowings under o ur 2023 Term Loan and 2023 Revolver Facility, excluding unamortized debt discount and\\ndeferred issuance costs. See Note 9. Debt for individual balances for our 2023 Term Loan and 2023 Revolver Facility. Based on the terms\\nof the 2023 Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2023, a change of one hundred basis points in the applicable interest rate would\\ncause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately $3.9 million on an annual basis.\\nEffects of Inflation\\nInflation has the potential to impact restaurant operating expenses at all levels. Whether that pressure originates from commodity costs,\\nlabor expenses, energy or transportation, this can have a material influence on restaurant margins.\\nSeveral strategies are employed to combat the ongoing inflationary pressures, including improvement to restaurant operating efficiencies,\\nstrategic menu price increases and supplier partner engagement via pricing programs. A well-balanced portfolio of varying risk\\nmanagement approaches related to supplier partner management assists in ensuring varying degrees of cost mitigation. These platforms\\nvary from long-term, fixed price agreements to commodity market-based indexed pricing programs.\\nWhile we have historically been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in operating expenses through productivity\\nimprovements, strategic menu prices increases and more efficient sourcing practices, there can be no assurance that we will be able to\\ncontinue to do so in the future.\\nIn addition, a portion of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales. As a result,\\nan increase in occupancy and related expenses will offset a proportionate share of any menu price increases at our restaurants.\\nLabor Costs\\nIncreases in minimum wage, health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs. We operate in\\nmany states and localities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage.\\nThe market for labor in the United States is competitive and has resulted in pressure on wages and may continue to do so in the future.\\nIncreases in minimum wage and market pressure may also result in increases in the wage rates paid for non-minimum wage positions.\\nMany states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions which could have a material\\nadverse effect on our labor costs in those areas.\\nPortillo's Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 35\\n\"),\n",

The Company is a C-corporation holding company owning a partnership interest in PHD\\nGroup Holdings, LLC, commonly referred to as an Up-C structure. In connection with the initial public offering, the Company entered into a\\nTax Receivable Agreement (\"TRA\") and recorded a liability under the TRA. Under the TRA, the Company will be required to pay certain\\npre-IPO owners 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, or local tax that the Company actually realizes. The\\npayments related to the initial and subsequent exchanges are treated as additional consideration paid, which in turn increases the tax\\nbasis of the Company’s investment in the Partnership.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\\nPortillo’s Inc. (\"Inc.\") was formed and incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 8, 2021. Inc. was formed for the purpose of\\ncompleting an initial public offering (\"IPO\") and related reorganization transactions (collectively, the \"Transactions”) in order to carry on the\\nbusiness of PHD Group Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries (\"Portillo\\'s OpCo\"). Following the consummation of the Transactions on October\\n20, 2021, Inc. became the sole managing member of Portillo’s OpCo, and a s sole managing member, Inc. operates and controls all of the\\nbusiness and affairs of Portillo\\'s OpCo. As a result, Inc. consolidates the financial results of Portillo\\'s OpCo and reports a non-controlling\\ninterest representing the economic interest in Portillo\\'s OpCo held by the other members of Portillo\\'s OpCo (the \"pre-IPO LLC Members\").\\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"Portillo\\'s,\" and the \"Company\" refer to Portillo\\'s Inc. and its\\nsubsidiaries, including Portillo\\'s OpCo.\\nThe Company operates fast-casual restaurants in 10 states, along with two food production commissaries in Illinois. As of December 31,\\n2023 and December 25, 2022, the Company had 83 and 71 restaurants in operation, respectively). The Company also had two\\nnon-traditional locations in operation as of December 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022. These non-traditional locations include a food\\ntruck and a ghost kitchen (small kitchen with no store-front presence, used to fill online orders). Portillo\\'s Inc., additionally has a 50 %\\ninterest in a single restaurant owned by C&O, which is excluded from the Company\\'s restaurant count. The Company’s principal corporate\\noffices are located in Oak Brook, Illinois.\\nInitial Public Offering\\nThe Company\\'s registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (Registration No. 333-259810), related to its IPO was declared effective\\nOctober 20, 2021, and the Company\\'s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol\\n\"PTLO\" on October 21, 2021. On October 25, 2021, the Company completed its IPO of 23,310,810 shares of the Company\\'s Class A\\ncommon stock ( including 3,040,540 shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) , at an offering price of $ 20.00\\nper share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $ 430.0  million after deducting underwriting discounts and\\ncommissions of $ 29.1  million and other offering expenses of approximately $ 7.1  million.\\nIn connection with the IPO, we completed the following:\\n• \\nWe amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of Portillo’s OpCo (\"LLC Agreement\") to, among other things,\\nconvert all outstanding equity interests (except for those redeemable preferred units which were redeemed in connection with the\\nIPO) into LLC Units.\\n• \\nWe became the sole managing member of Portillo\\'s OpCo. Because we manage and operate the business and control the\\nstrategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Portillo’s OpCo and because we also have a substantial financial interest in\\nPortillo’s OpCo, we consolidated the financial results of Portillo’s OpCo, and a portion of our net income was allocated to\\nnon-controlling interests to reflect the entitlement of the pre-IPO LLC Members who retained their equity ownership in Portillo\\'s\\nOpCo. In addition, because Portillo’s OpCo was under the common control of the pre-IPO LLC Members before and after the\\nTransactions, we measured the assets and liabilities of Portillo’s OpCo at their carrying amounts as of the date of the completion\\nof the Transactions.\\n• \\nWe amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to authorize the issuance of two series of common stock: Class A\\ncommon stock and Class B common stock. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitles its holder to\\none vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. The Class B common stock is not entitled to economic\\ninterests in Portillo’s Inc.\\nThe net proceeds and cash on hand were used as follows:\\n• \\nto repay the redeemable preferred units in full (including the redemption premium) of $ 221.7  million;\\n• \\nto repay all of the borrowings outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement (including any prepayment penalties) of $\\n158.1  million; and\\n• \\nto purchase LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock or shares of Class A common stock from certain\\npre-IPO LLC Members of $ 57.0  million.\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 46\\n'),\n",

We will retain the benefit of\\nthe remaining 15 % of these tax savings. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among other things, (i) generation of\\nfuture taxable income over the term of the TRA and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate sufficient taxable income in the\\naggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the related TRA payments.\\nSecondary Offerings\\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of 8,000,000 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock at\\nan offering price of $ 21.05 per share. On April 5, 2023, the Underwriter exercised its overallotment option in part, to purchase an\\nadditional 620,493 shares of the Company\\'s Class A common stock at an offering price of $ 21.05 per share (collectively the \"Q1 2023\\nSecondary Offering and Overallotment Option\"). We used all of the net proceeds from the Q1 2023 Secondary Offering and Overallotment\\nOption to purchase LLC Units and corresponding shares of Class B common stock from certain pre-IPO LLC Members and to repurchase\\nshares of Class A common stock from the Blocker Companies at a price per LLC Unit or share of Class A common stock, as applicable,\\nequal to the public offering price per share of Class A common stock, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The proceeds\\nfrom the Q1 2023 Secondary Offering and Overallotment Option were used to (i) purchase 2,269,776 existing shares of Class A common\\nstock from the shareholders of the Blocker Companies and (ii) redeem 6,350,717 LLC Units held by the pre-IPO LLC Members. In\\nconnection with the redemption, 6,350,717 shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the pre-IPO LLC Members and\\ncanceled, and the Company received 6,350,717 newly-issued LLC Units, increasing the Company\\'s total ownership interest in Portillo\\'s\\nOpCo. As a result, Portillo’s did not receive any proceeds from the offering, and the total number of shares of Class A common stock and\\nClass B common stock did not change; however, the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock increased by the same\\nnumber of the canceled shares of Class B common stock.\\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company completed two secondary offerings of 8,066,458 shares (including 66,458 shares\\nsold to the underwriters pursuant to their overallotment option) and 8,000,000 shares, respectively, of the Company\\'s Class A common\\nstock at an offering price of $ 23.75 and $ 22.69 , respectively, per share.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company owned 76.1 % of Portillo\\'s OpCo and the pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 23.9 % of\\nPortillo\\'s OpCo.\\nNOTE 2.     SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nThe Company does not have any components of other comprehensive income (loss) recorded within its consolidated financial statements,\\nand therefore, does not separately present a statement of comprehensive income (loss).\\nFiscal Year\\nThe Company operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday on or prior to December 31. In a 52-week fiscal year, each\\nquarterly period is comprised of 13 weeks. The additional week in a 53-week fiscal year is added to the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2023\\nconsisted of 53 weeks. Both fiscal 2022 and 2021 each consisted of 52 weeks. The 53rd week in fiscal 2023 coincided with Christmas,\\nresulting in six operating days. The fiscal periods presented in this report are years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and\\nDecember 26, 2021, respectively.

As the CODM reviews financial\\nperformance and allocates resources at a consolidated level on a recurring basis, the Company has one operating segment and one\\nreportable segment.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\\nCash includes amounts that are either held in the Company’s bank accounts or represent deposits in transit. Amounts receivable from\\ncredit card processors are considered cash equivalents because they are both short in term and highly liquid in nature and are typically\\nconverted to cash within three business days of the sales transactions.\\nRestricted cash includes amounts that are held in the Company’s bank accounts subject to minimum balance requirements for medical\\nclaim disbursements.\\nAccounts and Tenant Improvement Receivables\\nAccounts and tenant improvement receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates, tenant improvement receivables, and delivery\\nreceivables as well as receivables from related parties (see Note 17. Related Party Transactions). The Company evaluates the\\ncollectability of its Accounts and tenant improvement receivables based on a variety of factors, including historical experience, current and\\nfuture economic and market conditions and other factors. Based on these factors, no allowance for uncollectible accounts was recorded at\\nDecember 31, 2023 or December 25, 2022.\\nInventory\\nInventory, which consists mainly of food products, is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on the first-in,\\nfirst-out (FIFO) method. No other adjustment is deemed necessary to reduce inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value due to the\\nrapid turnover and high utilization of inventory.\\nThe Company operates two commissaries to supply the Company\\'s restaurants with several products and ensures product consistency\\nand quality. The commissaries derive revenue principally from the sale and distribution of food to our distributors, who, in turn, sell the\\nfood to the restaurants. This is considered under ASC 845, Non-Monetary Transactions, and the impact on the statement of operations is\\nnot material. These products are held as inventory at distributors on a short-term consignment basis. Inventories subject to these\\nconsignment arrangements are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and were $ 0.9  million and $ 0.7  million as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 25, 2022, respectively.\\nEquity Method Investment\\nThe Company has a 50 % interest in C&O. The Company accounts for the investment and financial results in the consolidated financial\\nstatements under the equity method of accounting as the Company has significant influence but does not have control. The investment is\\nadjusted to reflect the Company’s share of C&O’s earnings and losses to date and any distributions received.\\nLong-Lived Assets and Valuation\\nThe Company’s long-lived assets include property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization are\\ncomputed using the straight-line method. Except for leasehold improvements, depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of\\neach asset (generally ranging from three to ten years ). Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated lives of\\nthe asset or the lease term.\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 48\\n'),\n",

Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows that are expected to\\nbe generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is\\nrecognized in the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Restaurant-level assets are grouped by restaurant\\nfor the purpose of the impairment assessment because a restaurant represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. No impairment charge was recorded for any period presented.\\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events and\\ncircumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset is less than its carrying\\nvalue. The Company has one reporting unit which is evaluated for impairment annually. Fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using\\nthe market approach that uses publicly available market data, including publicly traded stock prices and total shares outstanding to\\ndetermine the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is\\nrecorded for the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value of the reporting unit.\\nThe Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks (collectively “trade names”). The Company\\nestimates the fair value of its trade names using a relief-from-royalty income approach. If the fair value of the trade name is less than its\\ncarrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the intangible\\nassets.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nThe Company discloses and recognizes the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation\\ntechniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\\nliability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance establishes three\\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\\nLevel 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\\nLevel 2 - Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for\\nidentical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little\\nor no market data.\\nOffering Costs\\nIn connection with the IPO, Portillo\\'s OpCo incurred certain legal, accounting, and other IPO-related costs. Such costs are recorded in\\nstockholders’ equity as a reduction from the proceeds of the offering. As of December 26, 2021, $ 7.1  million of offering costs had been\\nrecorded in stockholders\\' equity.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues from retail restaurants are presented net of discounts and recognized when food and beverage products are sold to the end\\ncustomer. Sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues and the obligation is included in accrued liabilities until the\\ntaxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities.\\nThe Company also offers delivery services to its customers. Delivery sales are generally fulfilled by third-party delivery partners whether\\nordered through the Portillo\\'s app and website (\"Dispatch Sales\") or through third-party delivery partners (\"Marketplace Sales\"). Dispatch\\nSales include delivery and service fees as the Company controls the delivery. Revenue from Dispatch Sales is recognized when food is\\ndelivered to the customer. For these sales, the Company receives payment directly from the customer at the time of sale. Revenue for\\nMarketplace Sales is recognized in the amount paid to the delivery partner by the customer for food and excludes delivery and service\\nfees charged by the third-party delivery partner as the Company does not control the delivery. Revenue from Marketplace Sales is\\nrecognized when food is delivered to the\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 49\\n'),\n",

Revenue Recognition for additional detail.\\nCommitments\\nThe majority of the food products the Company purchases are subject to changes in price primarily due to the effect of supply and\\ndemand of the commodities, in particular, proteins, dairy, produce and grains. Overall pricing agreements are established in an effort to\\nmaintain a more consistent food cost without creating long-term purchase commitments.\\nEmployee Benefits\\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) plan for all employees that are eligible based upon age and length of service. The expenses incurred for\\nCompany matching contributions to the plan were approximately $ 0.4  million, $ 0.4  million and $ 0.5 million for the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26, 2021, respectively.\\nThe Company offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to certain officers and other members of management. Under the plan,\\neligible employees may defer up to 80 % of their annual salary and annual bonus. The Company has elected to fund its deferred\\ncompensation obligations through a rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but such assets are\\nnot available for general corporate purposes. Assets held in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, which are purchased and held\\nprincipally for the purpose of selling them in the near term, and are classified as trading securities and carried at fair value.\\nEquity-Based Compensation\\nThe Company has issued non-qualified stock options, performance-based stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock\\nawards. Equity-based compensation expense is measured based on the grant-date fair value of those awards and is recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period. Equity-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is\\nreduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those\\nestimates and an adjustment to equity-based compensation expense will be recognized at that time. Equity-based compensation expense\\nis included within general and administrative expenses and labor in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe Company adopted an Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) in June 2022 under which qualifying employees may be granted\\npurchase rights to the Company’s common shares at not less than 85 % of the market price on the purchase date, subject to Company\\ndiscretion. The ESPP has a maximum of 250,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock available for issuance. Eligible\\nemployees are able to contribute up to 15 % of their gross base earnings for purchases under the ESPP through regular payroll\\ndeductions, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The expense incurred under the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2023\\nand December 25, 2022, was immaterial. The expense is included within general and administrative expenses and labor in the\\nconsolidated statement of operations.\\nAdvertising and Marketing Expenses\\nAdvertising costs are expensed the first-time advertising takes place, while the costs of producing advertising are expensed during\\nproduction and the costs of communicating advertising are expensed as services are received. Advertising and marketing expenses\\ntotaled $ 5.9  million, $ 4.0  million and $ 3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 25, 2022 and December 26,\\n2021, respectively. Advertising and marketing expenses included in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of\\noperations primarily relate to sponsorships, restaurant merchandising and charitable giving; and those expenses included in general and\\nadministrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations primarily consist of branding initiatives. The year-over-year change\\nfor 2023 is primarily related to an advertising campaign in the Chicagoland market in the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nPortillo's Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 50\\n\"),\n",

Certain costs\\nincurred during the application development stage are capitalized and included within prepaid expenses or other assets, depending on the\\nlong or short-term nature of such costs, in line with the Company\\'s policy on the accounting for prepaid software hosting arrangements.\\nCosts incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Capitalized cloud-based\\nsoftware implementation costs are amortized, beginning on the date the related software or module is ready for its intended use, on a\\nstraight-line basis over the remaining term of the hosting arrangement as a component of general and administrative expenses, the same\\nline item as the expense for the associated hosting arrangement.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $ 2.0  million of capitalized cloud-based software implementation costs made up of $ 0.3\\n million recorded within prepaid expenses and $ 1.7  million recorded within other assets related to a new enterprise resource planning\\nsystem.\\nLeases\\nOn December 27, 2021, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , along with related clarifications and improvements,\\nusing a modified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after December 27, 2021 are presented under ASC\\n842. Prior period amounts were not revised and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 840, the accounting standard then in\\neffect.\\nThe Company currently leases land for its retail restaurants and commissaries, and office space under various long-term operating lease\\nagreements that expire on various dates through 2068. We also lease equipment, which primarily consists of restaurant equipment and\\ncopiers. We have immaterial short-term operating leases, such as those for seasonal rentals and training spaces. We evaluate the\\ncontracts to determine whether the contract involves the use of property or equipment, which is either explicitly or implicitly identified. We\\nevaluate whether we control the use of the asset, which is determined by assessing whether we obtain substantially all economic benefits\\nfrom the use of the asset, and whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. If these criteria are met and we have identified a\\nlease, we account for the contract under the requirements of ASC 842.\\nUpon the possession of a leased asset, we determine its classification as an operating or finance lease. As of December 31, 2023, all of\\nour leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. We\\nmake judgments regarding the probable term for each lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as operating\\nor financing, as well as the amount of straight-line rent expense in a particular period. Generally, the leases for the Company\\'s restaurant\\nlocations have an initial term of 10 years to 20 years and typically provide for renewal options in five-year increments, as well as rent\\nescalations. Renewal options are generally recognized as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as it is reasonably certain at\\ncommencement date that we would exercise the options to extend the lease. Some of our real estate leases provide for base rent, plus if\\napplicable, additional rent based on gross sales, as defined in each lease agreement, which is considered to be variable rent. When the\\nachievement of such sales thresholds are deemed to be probable, contingent rent is accrued in proportion to the sales recognized during\\nthe period. For operating leases that include rent holidays and rent escalation clauses, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line\\nbasis over the lease term from the date we take possession of the leased property. Lease expense incurred before a restaurant opens is\\nrecorded in pre-opening expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Once a restaurant opens, we record the straight-line\\nlease expense and any contingent rent, if applicable, in occupancy on the consolidated statements of operations. Many of our leases also\\nrequire us to pay real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs and other occupancy costs which are included in occupancy, other\\noperating expenses, or pre-opening expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and is generally considered to be variable\\nrent. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (\"short-term operating lease\"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a\\nstraight-line basis over such term, and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nPer the ASC 842 requirements, a lessee is required to use the rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable; alternatively, it would\\nuse the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing\\nrates corresponding to the maturities of our leases. We estimate this rate based on prevailing financial market conditions, indications for\\nthe Company\\'s credit rating, and other benchmarks related to the Company\\'s outstanding secured borrowings.\\nWe expend cash for leasehold improvements to build out our leased premises. Generally, a portion of the leasehold improvements and\\nbuilding costs are reimbursed by our landlords as landlord incentives pursuant to agreed-upon terms in our lease agreements. If obtained,\\nlandlord incentives usually take the form of cash, full or partial credits against our future minimum or contingent rents otherwise payable\\nby us, or a combination thereof. In most cases, the tenant improvement allowances are received after we take possession of the property,\\nas we meet required milestones during the construction of the property. We include these amounts in the measurement of the initial\\noperating lease liability, which are also reflected as a reduction to the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset.\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 51\\n'),\n",

These are expensed as incurred prior to the restaurant opening for business.\\nIncome and Other Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and\\nliabilities related to the expected future tax consequences arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases\\nof assets and liabilities based on enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to\\nreverse. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or laws are included in income tax expense in the period of enactment. A valuation\\nallowance is recognized if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be recognized. In\\nmaking such determination, the Company considers all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities,\\nprojected future taxable income, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and recent and expected future results of operations. The\\nassumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we\\nuse to manage our business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates,\\nwhich could have a material impact on the amount of deferred tax assets we ultimately realize.\\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\\') was signed into law. The CARES Act\\nintended to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act also allowed eligible employers to\\ndefer the remittance of employer federal payroll taxes otherwise payable during calendar year 2020 and remit half of such deferred\\namounts on or before December 31, 2021 and half on or before December 31, 2022. The Company deferred approximately $ 5.4  million\\nof federal payroll tax remittances under this provision as of December 27, 2020, of which $ 2.7  million was paid during the year ended\\nDecember 26, 2021 and the remaining deferred balance of $ 2.7  million was paid during the year ended December 25, 2022.\\nTax Receivable Agreement\\nThe Company is party to a TRA with certain pre-IPO LLC Members that provides for the payment by the Company of 85 % of the amount\\nof tax benefits, if any, that Portillo\\'s Inc. actually realizes or in some cases is deemed to realize as a result of certain transactions. We\\naccount for the TRA liability in accordance with ASC 450 - Contingencies. Amounts payable under the TRA are contingent upon, among\\nother things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the TRA and (ii) future changes in tax laws. If we do not generate\\nsufficient taxable income in the aggregate over the term of the TRA to utilize the tax benefits, then we would not be required to make the\\nrelated TRA payments. Therefore, we would only recognize a liability for TRA payments if we determine it is probable that we will\\ngenerate sufficient future taxable income over the term of the TRA to utilize the related tax benefits. The timing and amount of aggregate\\npayments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of taxable income generated by\\nPortillo\\'s OpCo each year and the applicable tax rates. Refer to Note 1. Description Of Business for additional information on the TRA.\\nThe amounts recorded for both the deferred tax assets and the liability for the Company\\'s obligations under the TRA will be estimated at\\nthe time of any purchase or exchange as a reduction to shareholders\\' equity, and the effects of changes in any of the Company\\'s\\nestimates after this date will be included in net income or loss. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be\\nincluded in net income or loss.\\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-\\naverage number of shares outstanding.\\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share adjusts the basic earnings (loss) per unit attributable to shareholders and the weighted-average number\\nof units of shares outstanding for the potential dilutive impact of shares, using the treasury-stock method. Diluted earnings (loss) per share\\nconsiders the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential\\ncommon units would have an anti-dilutive effect.\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 52\\n'),\n",

The 2014\\nPlan permitted the granting of awards to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company and affiliates in the form of\\noptions, unit appreciation rights, Restricted Class A Units, unrestricted Class A Units, Performance Awards and awards convertible into or\\notherwise based on Class A Units. Prior to the IPO, the 2014 Plan gave broad powers to the Company’s board of managers for its\\nadministration and interpretation, including the authority to select the individuals to be granted awards and rights to prescribe the\\nparticular form and conditions of each award to be granted. Under the 2014 Plan, the number of shares and exercise price of each option\\nwere determined by the board of managers, or a committee designated by the board of managers. The awards granted were generally\\nexercisable within a 10-year period from the date of grant.\\nThe unit option grants were equally divided between (i) options subject to time-based vesting, and (ii) options subject to both time-based\\nand performance-based vesting. The time-based vesting options vest, in general, in equal annual installments over a 5-year period and\\nhave a 10-year term from the date of the grant. The options subject to both time-based and performance-based vesting have a ten-year\\nterm from the date of the grant and vest, in general, in equal annual installments over a 5-year period from the date of grant, subject to\\nacceleration in the event of a sale transaction, and have a performance condition that is satisfied upon achievement of a specified internal\\nrate of return and a minimum multiple of invested capital. In connection with the IPO, the performance condition was waived and all such\\noptions became subject to time-based vesting only. As a result of the waiver and resultant modification in the terms of the performance-\\nvesting awards, we recognized a cash compensation expense of approximately $ 1.3 million and a non-cash compensation expense of\\napproximately $ 26.2 million , each at the modification date in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 .\\nIn connection with the IPO, each option outstanding under the 2014 Plan, whether vested or unvested, was substituted for an option to\\npurchase a number of shares of Class A common stock under the 2021 Plan, and the option holders received a cash payment in respect\\nof their options (whether vested or unvested) in an aggregate amount of approximately $ 6.6  million, which was recorded in the fourth\\nquarter of 2021.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nthere are no ongoing U.S. federal, state or local income tax return examinations.\\nTax Receivable Agreement\\nPursuant to the Company\\'s election under section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), the Company expects to obtain an\\nincrease in its share of the tax basis in the net assets of Portillo\\'s OpCo when LLC Units are exchanged by other members. The Company\\nintends to treat any exchanges of LLC Units as direct purchases of LLC Units for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These increases in\\ntax basis may reduce the amounts that would otherwise be paid in the future to the U.S. federal, state and local authorities. These\\nincreases may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to\\nthose assets.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we estimate that our obligation for future payments under the TRA totaled $ 299.8 million. The Company made\\npayments of $ 0.8  million under the TRA during the year ended December 31, 2023 relating to tax year 2021 and we expect a payment\\nof\\nPortillo\\'s Inc. \\nForm 10-K | 69\\n'),\n",

(the “ Company ”) and the handling of confidential information about the Company and the companies with\\nwhich the Company does business. The Company’s Board of Directors (the “ Board ”) has adopted this Policy to promote\\ncompliance with federal, state and foreign securities laws that prohibit certain persons who are aware of material nonpublic\\ninformation about a company from: (i) trading in securities of that company; or (ii) providing material nonpublic information\\nto other persons who may trade on the basis of that information.

The Company may also determine that other persons should be subject to this Policy, such as contractors or\\nconsultants who have access to material nonpublic information.

Any information that could be expected to affect a company’s\\nstock price, whether it is positive or negative, should be considered material. There is no bright-line standard for assessing\\nmateriality; rather, materiality is based on an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances and is often evaluated by\\nenforcement authorities with the benefit of hindsight. While it is not possible to define all categories of material information,\\nsome examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are:\\n• \\nProjections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance;\\n• \\nChanges to previously announced earnings guidance, or the decision to suspend earnings guidance;\\n'),\n",

In order to establish that the information has been disclosed to the public, it may be necessary to\\ndemonstrate that the information has been widely disseminated. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\\n(“ SEC ”) and press releases are generally regarded as public information.

For\\nthese reasons, any director, officer or other employee of the Company who purchases Company Securities in the open market\\nmay not sell any Company Securities of the same class during the six months following the purchase (or vice versa).\\nShort Sales : Short sales of Company Securities ( i.e. , the sale of a security that the seller does not own) may evidence an\\nexpectation on the part of the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore have the potential to signal to the\\nmarket that the seller lacks confidence in the Company’s prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce a seller’s incentive to\\nseek to improve the Company’s performance. For these reasons, short sales of Company Securities are prohibited.

(Short sales arising from certain\\ntypes of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph below captioned “Hedging Transactions.”)\\nPublicly-Traded Options : Given the relatively short term of publicly-traded options, transactions in options may create the\\nappearance that a director, officer or employee is trading based on material nonpublic information and focus a director’s,\\nofficer’s or other employee’s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company’s long-term objectives.\\nAccordingly, transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities, on an exchange or in any other organized\\nmarket, are prohibited by this Policy. (Option positions arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by\\nthe next paragraph below.)\\nHedging  Transactions  :  Hedging  or  monetization  transactions  can  be  accomplished  through  a  number  of  possible\\nmechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and\\nexchange funds. Such hedging transactions may permit a director, officer or employee to continue to own Company\\nSecurities obtained through employee benefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When\\nthat occurs, the director, officer or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company’s other shareholders.\\nTherefore, the Company prohibits you from engaging in such transactions. Any person wishing to enter into such an\\narrangement must first submit the proposed transaction for approval by the General Counsel. Any request for pre-clearance\\nof a hedging or similar arrangement must be submitted to the General Counsel at least fourteen (14) business days prior to\\nthe proposed execution of documents evidencing the proposed transaction and must set forth a justification for the proposed\\ntransaction.\\nMargin Accounts and Pledged Securities : Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by\\nthe broker without the customer’s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or\\nhypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale\\nor foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledger is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not\\npermitted to trade in Company Securities, directors, officers and other employees are prohibited from holding Company\\nSecurities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as collateral for a loan. (Pledges of Company\\nSecurities arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by the paragraph above captioned “Hedging\\nTransactions.”)\\nStanding and Limit Orders : Standing and limit orders (except standing and limit orders under approved Rule 10b5-1 Plans,\\nas described below) create heightened risks for insider trading violations similar to the use of margin accounts. There is no\\ncontrol over the timing of purchases or sales that result from standing instructions to a broker, and as a result the broker\\ncould execute a transaction when a director, officer or other employee is in possession of material nonpublic information.\\nThe Company therefore discourages placing standing or limit orders on Company Securities. If a person subject to this\\nPolicy determines that they must use a standing order or limit order, the order should be limited to short duration and should\\notherwise comply with the restrictions and procedures outlined below under the heading “Pre-Clearance and Blackouts.”\\n'),\n",

These additional procedures are applicable only to those individuals described\\nbelow.\\nPre-Clearance Procedures : Directors, officers, accounting employees with the title of director or higher, investor relations\\nemployees that assist with earnings releases, legal department employees that assist with preparing SEC filings, any\\nemployees on the Company’s disclosure committee, and any persons designated by the General Counsel as being subject to\\nthese procedures, as well as the Family Members and Controlled Entities of such persons (“ Covered Senior Persons ”), may\\nnot engage in any transaction in Company Securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the General\\nCounsel. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to the General Counsel at least two (2) business days in advance of\\nthe proposed transaction. The General Counsel is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance,\\nand may determine not to permit the transaction. If a person seeks pre- clearance and permission to engage in the transaction\\nis denied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company Securities, and should not inform any\\nother person of the restriction. Pre-clearance will not be granted during a Blackout Period, as defined below.\\nWhen a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any\\nmaterial nonpublic information about the Company, and should describe fully those circumstances to the General Counsel.\\nThe requestor should also indicate whether he or she has effected any non-exempt “opposite-way” transactions within the\\npast six months, and should be prepared to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5. To ensure\\ncompliance with SEC Rule 144 and the timely filing of Form 144, the sale of any Company securities by individuals required\\nto obtain pre-clearance must be conducted through Fidelity Investments.\\nIf a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in the transaction is granted, then such trade must be effected\\nwithin five (5) business days of receipt of pre-clearance unless an exception is granted. Such person must promptly notify the\\nGeneral Counsel following the completion of the transaction. A person who has not effected a transaction within the time\\nlimit may not engage in such transaction without again obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the General Counsel.\\nQuarterly Blackout Periods : Covered Senior Persons may not conduct any transactions involving the Company’s Securities\\n(other than as specified by this Policy), during a “Blackout Period” beginning fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the end of\\neach fiscal quarter and ending after the close of trading on the first full trading day following the date of the public release of\\nthe Company’s earnings results for that quarter. For example, these persons would be permitted to conduct transactions in\\nCompany Securities on Tuesday if earnings results are publicly released prior to trading hours on Monday, but on Wednesday\\nif earnings results are released during or after trading hours on Monday. In other words, Covered Senior Persons may only\\nconduct transactions in Company Securities during the “Window Period” beginning after the close of trading on the first full\\ntrading day following the public release of the Company’s quarterly earnings and ending fourteen (14) days prior to the close\\nof the next fiscal quarter.\\nEvent-Specific Blackout Periods : From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by\\nonly a few directors, officers and/or employees, such as a cybersecurity\\n'),\n",

So long as the event remains material and nonpublic, the persons designated by the General Counsel may not trade\\nCompany Securities. In addition, the Company’s financial results may be sufficiently material in a particular fiscal quarter\\nthat, in the judgment of the General Counsel, designated persons should refrain from trading in Company Securities even\\nsooner than the typical Blackout Period described above. In that situation, the General Counsel may notify these persons that\\nthey should not trade in the Company’s Securities, without disclosing the reason for the restriction. The existence of an\\nevent-specific trading restriction period or extension of a Blackout Period will not be announced to the Company as a whole,\\nand should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the General Counsel has not designated you as a person who\\nshould not trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade while aware of material nonpublic information.\\nExceptions. The quarterly trading restrictions and event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to those transactions to\\nwhich this Policy does not apply, as described above under the headings “Transactions Under Company Plans” and\\n“Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale.” Further, the requirement for pre-clearance, the quarterly trading restrictions\\nand event-driven trading restrictions do not apply to transactions conducted pursuant to approved Rule 10b5-1 plans,\\ndescribed under the heading “Rule 10b5-1 Plans.\\nR ULE 10 B 5-1 P LANS\\nRule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense, under certain conditions, against allegations that an\\ninsider traded in the Company Securities while aware of material non-public information.

If the plan meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and the Rule 10b5-1\\nTrading Plans Policy, Company Securities may be purchased or sold without regard to certain insider trading restrictions,\\nincluding blackout and pre-clearance requirements.\\nTo comply with this Policy, prior written approval of the General Counsel (or their designee) must be obtained prior to the\\nadoption, amendment or termination of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan and meet the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, as interpreted by the\\nGeneral Counsel. In general, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be entered into at a time when the person entering into the plan is not\\naware of material non-public information and not during a Blackout Period. Once the plan is adopted, the person must not\\nexercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded, or the date of the\\ntrade.

Introduction . The board of directors (the “Board”) of Portillo’s Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this\\npolicy (the “Policy”) to provide for the recovery by the Company, in the event of a Recovery Trigger (as defined below), of\\ncertain incentive-based compensation received by certain current and former executive officers, as further specified in this\\nPolicy.\\nThis Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Listing Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\\n(“Nasdaq”) relating to erroneously awarded compensation.\\nSection 2. Administration .   The Board will administer and interpret this Policy and make all determinations for the\\nadministration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Board will be final, binding, and conclusive on all affected\\nindividuals. At its discretion, the Board may delegate the administration to the Compensation Committee or a subcommittee\\nthereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any director who is a Covered Individual (as defined below) under this Policy may not\\nparticipate in discussions related to, or vote on, any potential recovery of their Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined\\nbelow) under this Policy.\\nSection 3. Statement of Policy . Following the occurrence of a Recovery Trigger, the Company will recover reasonably\\npromptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined below) from the applicable Covered Individual(s), except as in\\naccordance with this Policy. The Company will employ the means of recovery and process approved by the Board from time to\\ntime, which such means will appropriately balance cost and speed and consider the particular facts and circumstances in each\\ncase where recovery is owed.\\nSection 4. Covered Individuals Subject to this Policy . The Policy is applicable to any current or former “executive\\nofficer” of the Company as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5608 who “received” (see Section 7 below) the subject Incentive-Based\\nCompensation after beginning service as an “executive officer” and who served as an “executive officer” at any time during the\\nperformance period (for that Incentive-Based Compensation) covered by the Recovery Period (as defined below) (together,\\n“Covered Individuals”).\\nSection 5. Recovery Trigger for Accounting Restatements . A “Recovery Trigger” will have occurred upon the\\nearlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board or the Audit Committee of the Board concludes, or reasonably should have concluded,\\nthat the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement (as defined below), or (ii) the date a court, regulator or\\nother legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\\nFor the purposes of this Policy, an “Accounting Restatement” means a restatement of the Company’s financial\\nstatements due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities\\nlaws, including any required accounting restatement (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is\\nmaterial to the previously issued financial statements (e.g., requiring a company to file an Item 4.02 Form 8-K) or (ii) that\\nwould result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, the following retrospective accounting changes shall not be deemed an Accounting Restatement:\\n(i) application of a change in accounting principle; (ii) revisions to reportable segment information due to a change in the\\nstructure of an issuer’s internal organization; (iii) reclassification due to a discontinued operation; (iv) application of a change\\nin reporting entity, such as from a reorganization of entities under common control; (v) revisions for stock splits, reverse stock\\nsplits, stock dividends or other changes in capital structure, etc; or (vi) an “out-of-period\\n'),\n",

Recovery Period. The Policy will apply to Incentive-Based Compensation (defined below) “received” (see\\nSection 7 below) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which a Recovery Trigger occurs\\n(the “Recovery Period”). In addition to these last three completed fiscal years, this Policy applies to any transition period (that\\nresults from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years.\\nHowever, a transition period between the last day of the Company’s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal\\nyear that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year.\\nSection 7. Compensation “Received” . Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “received” by a Covered Individual\\nin  the  Company’s  fiscal  period  during  which  the  Financial  Reporting  Measure  (as  defined  below)  specified  in  the\\nIncentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the applicable award occurs after the end of\\nthat period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the only compensation subject to this Policy is\\nIncentive-Based Compensation “received” by Covered Individuals on or after October 2, 2023 and while the Company had a\\nclass of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association.\\nSection 8. Incentive-Based Compensation Subject to Recovery . Any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested\\nbased wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure (“Incentive-Based Compensation”) will be\\nsubject to this Policy. Examples of Incentive-Based Compensation may include, but are not limited to , non-equity incentive\\nplan awards that are earned based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure; bonuses paid from a “bonus\\npool,” the size of which is determined based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure; other cash awards\\nbased on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure; restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, stock\\noptions, and stock appreciation rights that are granted or become vested based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial\\nReporting Measure; and proceeds received upon the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or\\nvested based wholly or in part on satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure.\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the following are not considered Incentive-Based Compensation: salaries; bonuses paid\\nsolely at the discretion of the Board that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting\\nMeasure; bonuses  paid  solely upon satisfying  one or more subjective  standards  (e.g., demonstrated leadership) and/or\\ncompletion of a specified employment period; non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more\\nstrategic measures (e.g., consummating a merger or divestiture), or operational measures (e.g., opening a specified number of\\nstores, completion of a project, increase in market share); and equity awards for which the grant is not contingent upon\\nachieving any Financial Reporting Measure and where vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified employment\\nperiod (e.g., time-based options, restricted stock or RSUs) and/or attaining one or more non-Financial Reporting Measure.\\nA “Financial Reporting Measure” is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such\\nmeasures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need\\nnot be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC. Incentive-Based Compensation is subject\\nto recovery under this Policy even if the Accounting Restatement was not due to any misconduct or failure of oversight on the\\npart a Covered Individual.\\nSection 9. Erroneously Awarded Compensation . In the event of a Recovery Trigger, the Company will seek to\\nrecover from any applicable Covered Individual an amount of Incentive-Based Compensation “received” (see Section 7 above)\\nthat exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been “received” (see Section 7 above) by such Covered Individual had it\\nbeen determined based on the\\n'),\n",

Method of Recovery . The Board will determine in its sole discretion how the Company will effect any\\nreimbursement or recovery pursuant to this Policy, including, but not limited to the following: (1) seeking repayment from the\\nCovered Individual; (2) reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or\\narrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Covered Individual under any compensation, bonus, incentive,\\nequity and other benefit plan, agreement, policy or arrangement maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates; (3)\\ncanceling any unvested or unpaid award (whether cash- or equity-based) previously granted to the Covered Individual; (4) if it\\ncan be accomplished reasonably promptly, withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including payment of any\\npermissible discretionary bonus payments or amounts) or grants of compensatory or equity awards that otherwise would have\\nbeen made in accordance with the Company’s applicable compensation practices or decisions; or (5) any combination of the\\nforegoing.\\nSection 12. Policy Relationship to other Recoupment or Clawback Provisions . This Policy supplements and does\\nnot replace any requirements imposed pursuant to applicable law or regulations, any clawback or recovery provision in the\\nCompany’s other policies, plans, awards and individual employment or other agreements (including any recovery provisions in\\nthe Company’s equity incentive plans or award agreements), and any other rights or remedies available to the Company,\\nincluding termination of employment.\\nIn the event that a recovery is initiated under this Policy, amounts of Incentive-Based Compensation previously\\nrecovered by the Company from a Covered Individual pursuant to the Company’s other policies, plans, awards and individual\\nemployment or other agreements shall be considered so that recovery is not duplicative, provided that in the event of a conflict\\nbetween any applicable clawback or recoupment provision, including this Policy, the right to clawback or recoupment shall be\\ninterpreted to result in the greatest clawback or recoupment from the Covered Individual.\\nSection 13. Amendment or Termination of Policy . The Board may amend this Policy at any time, and from time to\\ntime, in its discretion. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\\nSection 14. Disclosure . The Company is required to file this Policy as an exhibit to its Form 10-K filed with the SEC\\nand is also subject to the disclosure requirements of Item 402(w) of Regulation S-K, SEC Rule 10D-1 and Nasdaq Rule 5608,\\nas applicable.\\nSection 15.

The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Covered Individual against the loss\\nof Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance\\npurchased by any Covered Individual to fund potential obligations to the Company under this Policy.\\n'),\n",
